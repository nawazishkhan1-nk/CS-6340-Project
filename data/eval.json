{"data": [{"title": "Nature Causes Havoc", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Devastating tornadoes too numerous to count roared across the American states of Oklahoma and Kansas late yesterday. At least 46 people were killed and hundreds were left injured and homeless. A tornado is an extremely violent windstorm that is usually created within a thunderstorm or hurricane. The recognizable shape of the tornado is the swirling funnel cloud that extends from the base of a storm cloud to the ground. The Oklahoma state medical examiner said 40 people were killed in Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms, the largest of which formed about 110 kilometres southwest of Oklahoma City - cutting a path at least a kilometre wide as it moved north and east. About 400 kilometres miles north, a tornado spawned by the same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kansas and its suburb of Haysville. Hospitals reported treating more than 80 people. Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office said today that the initial count of 10 deaths proved wrong when authorities realized victims had been counted twice. But authorities still fear more dead will be found. \"It is worse than what you can see,\" says Bob Thompson, a battalion chief for the Sedgwick County Fire Department. \"We'll probably find more deaths.\" The storm system began in southwest Oklahoma and moved into the neighboring state of Kansas. It included several tornadoes, one of which was nearly two kilometres wide at times. Witnesses say the twister was like a huge white train that came crashing through their homes. Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his companions were critically injured. \"I have no trailer,\" Harris said. \"We all rolled in it. It was the worst experience in my life.\" The Oklahoma City twister is ranked as an F-4 tornado, the second-strongest classification. An F-4 tornado has a wind speed of 333-419 kilometres per hour. It can level well-constructed houses, structures with weak foundations can be blown off some distance, cars are thrown and objects like trees can become airborne like missiles. Scientists rank tornadoes on the Fujita scale of intensity, named after a University of Chicago researcher. On average, only one F-5 tornado hits the United States each year.", "qas": [{"question": "Which U.S. states were hit by the numerous tornados?", "id": "1999-W19-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Oklahoma and Kansas", "answer_start": 81}, {"text": "Kansas and Oklahoma", "answer_start": 842}]}, {"question": "What is the recognizable shape of a tornado?", "id": "1999-W19-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the swirling funnel cloud that extends from the base of a storm cloud to the ground", "answer_start": 338}]}, {"question": "Who said 40 people were killed in Oklahoma alone?", "id": "1999-W19-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Oklahoma state medical examiner", "answer_start": 423}]}, {"question": "When did authorities discover the initial count of 10 deaths in Sedgwick County was wrong?", "id": "1999-W19-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "when they realized victims had been counted twice", "answer_start": 1068}]}, {"question": "Where was Chad Harris when the tornado hit?", "id": "1999-W19-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in his mobile home", "answer_start": 1624}, {"text": "his mobile home in Haysville", "answer_start": 1624}]}, {"question": "What is the wind speed range of an F-4 tornado?", "id": "1999-W19-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "333-419 kilometres per hour", "answer_start": 1965}]}, {"question": "How many F-5 tornados hit the United States each year on average?", "id": "1999-W19-2-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "one", "answer_start": 500}]}, {"question": "Why is the scale of intensity for tornados called the Fujita scale?", "id": "1999-W19-2-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "named after a University of Chicago researcher", "answer_start": 2231}]}, {"question": "How do scientists rank tornados?", "id": "1999-W19-2-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Fujita scale", "answer_start": 2200}, {"text": "Fujita scale of intensity", "answer_start": 2204}]}]}]}, {"title": "Canadians Lend Kosovars a Hand", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Residents of British Columbia's Lower Mainland seem to be freer with their cash than they are with their time. The Red Cross is thanking the public for donating more than $250,000 to help refugees in the Balkans over the past two months. Spokesperson Adrienne Bakker says the Red Cross Appeal has received an average of $20,000 a week. But B.C.'s attorney general says few people have come forward to help the Kosovo refugees who will soon arrive in British Columbia. Ujal Dosnajh stresses there is no cost, and no requirement to put refugees in homes. Mr. Dosanjh says he is looking for more than 200 sponsors who can provide emotional and psychological support. Church groups, schools, and businesses can offer their assistance to the government. \"Kosovars\" is the term generally used for people of Albanian ethnic heritage who live in the southern Yugolsavian province of Kosovo. In Calgary, Alberta, for example, the Unitarian Church is sponsoring a group of refugees. This means everything from finding clothes and shelter to finding schools for the children and jobs for their parents. One member of the church, Thordis Gutnick, will be spending the next couple of months teaching English to the refugees. She is looking forward to it as she says it will allow her to show them what a wonderful country Canada can be. She is also looking forward to discussing the NATO bombing with them. Ms. Gutnick has been opposed to the bombing since it began on March 24. She wants to hear the opinions of the refugees and try and better understand what is happening in Yugoslavia. So far nearly 5,000 Kosovo refugees have come to Canada. But they won't be the last displaced Kosovars headed here. More refugees will continue to arrive under Canada's family reunification plan. \"Some 2,000 people have been identified as potentially eligible for that program. Of those, 400 have already arrived,\" says Raphael Girard, Canada's ambassador to Yugoslavia. Canada has set no limit for the number of refugees eligible for the family reunification plan. When the airlift ends Wednesday, Canada will have fulfilled its pledge to accept 5,000 refugees. Officials say Ottawa won't take in more unless requested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Out of 135,000 spaces for refugees offered by the international community, only 55,000 have been transported out of the region in the last month. The ambassador said that there is anxiety among the Kosovar leadership that by taking refugees so far afield \"many of these people will not return and in so doing Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic's agenda (of getting rid of ethnic Albanians living in the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo) will be achieved.\" In total, 1.6 million people have fled Kosovo as Yugoslavian Serb forces purge the province of ethnic Albanians.

But roughly 1,500 residents were able to return to their homes last night as winds died and the danger decreased. A number of homes and businesses on the town's northern edge were destroyed. And the evacuees remained on alert, ready to run again on a moment's notice if hot spots flared up. La Ronge is a community of 2,800 people located 300 kilometres north of Saskatoon. It is located on lac La Ronge. Residents \"have to go back with the understanding that they could be called out at any moment,\" says RCMP Cpl. Gary MacDonald. Although the evacuees were told they could spend the night in the local arena, virtually all the townspeople chose to sleep in their own beds. Volunteer firefighters were to remain on patrol all night, ready to run door-to-door and give the alert if winds picked up and sparked a new blaze. Trees were still burning at Gary Vettree's in Eagle Point, which was directly in the path of a fast-moving fire. His was one of two homes still standing; seven houses just down the road burned to the ground. Vettree saved his house by soaking it with water. \"Scary, really scary,\" he says of the blaze, \"Smoke, fire, animals running all over, rabbits, birds.\" After days of dry winds and electrical storms - there have been 3,000 lightning strikes over the last couple days - the fire began in the bush southwest of town at about noon Thursday. Strong winds pushed it northeast and by 1 p.m., when the fire grew dangerously close to a bulk fuel station, RCMP were running from door to door asking people to leave. \"People were crying,\" says one resident, who loaded up his photo albums and hooked his prized boat to his car before leaving his home with his wife. \"At that point the fire was about a quarter-mile away.\" The fire shot six metres above the trees as it roared through the industrial area of town. Highway 2 was closed. \"I watched the fire, when it was just feet away from an industrial shop, burn the end of the building,\" said the man, who didn't want his name used. Evacuees were housed in the local health clinic and a hockey arena. \"In some places it was so bad you could hardly see,\" says restaurant worker Angela Krienke. Some evacuees with respiratory problems received treatment. There are 459 firefighters fighting the fires in Northern Saskatchewan. Working or on standby for fire suppression activities are: 24 helicopters, 12 water bomber aircraft, 8 bulldozers and 1 swamp tractor. Early damage estimates include a shop burned out in the industrial area. Several mobile homes were destroyed, as were four large buildings and four cabins at a local lakeside resort. No injuries were reported. \"It's amazing that so much vegetation on the perimeter of our community was totally destroyed and we were very fortunate that so little property was destroyed,\" says La Ronge Mayor Joe Hordyski. \"It's just a miracle.\" In northern Alberta, meanwhile, a forest fire just north of Fort McMurray threatened the region's power supply as it burned out of control Thursday. There are a number of fires burning near Fort McMurray, three out of control. None were threatening the town. Lower winds and less smoke removed the need to evacuate the small aboriginal community of Janvier, about 120 kilometres southeast of Fort McMurray.", "qas": [{"question": "How many people live in La Ronge?", "id": "1999-W22-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "2,800", "answer_start": 472}]}, {"question": "Who is the mayor of La Ronge?", "id": "1999-W22-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Joe Hordyski", "answer_start": 2976}]}, {"question": "Why did Gary Vettree's house not burn down?", "id": "1999-W22-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he soaked it with water", "answer_start": 1220}]}, {"question": "How high was the fire in the industrial area of town?", "id": "1999-W22-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six metres above the trees", "answer_start": 1910}]}, {"question": "Where were the evacuees taken when the fire threatened their homes?", "id": "1999-W22-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the local health clinic and a hockey arena", "answer_start": 2182}]}, {"question": "When were the evacuees able to go back to their homes?", "id": "1999-W22-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "last night", "answer_start": 217}, {"text": "the night of May 27, 1999", "answer_start": 735}]}]}]}, {"title": "Boy Can t Pick Treatment", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A judge in Saskatchewan has ruled that a 13-year-old boy cannot make his own decisions about treatment for the cancer that is destroying his bones.

But the boy refuses to continue the treatment. Today, Judge A. R. Rothery ruled that Tyrell is influenced by his father, and cannot make an independent decision. The judge said the boy is misinformed, and that social services must now step in to help him. Experts testified in court in Saskatoon yesterday that Tyrell is capable of making a decision, but that his decision is based on misinformation from his father. Tyrell s father wants him to undergo alternative therapy at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. The treatment consists of herbal remedies, doses of vitamins and a special diet. Psychologist Jo Nanson said Tyrell believes the tumour on his thigh bone is not cancerous because his father told him so. He also believes that herbal and vitamin treatments at the Tijuana clinic will make him well again. Nanson said Tyrell s only source of information is his father, who won t permit his son to speak alone with a medical doctor. Nanson also said that Tyrell wouldn t think of disobeying his father. A psychiatrist who talked to Tyrell to find out what he knew about his condition told the court that the boy hasn t received enough medical information.

Canadian Wang Shui-Bo will also be in the audience hoping to win. Wang Shui-Bo is nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Documentary for his half-hour film \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square.\" The film is a Wang's perspective on the events that led up to June 4, 1989, when Chinese government troops opened fire on student demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Wang traces his personal journey through a collage of original artwork mixed with family and archival photographs.  It's a journey that begins with Wang as a loyal Communist, full of the political idealism common in China under the early years of leader Mao Tse Tung. It ends with him as an anti-government activist willing to risk his life to uphold the first stirrings of democracy. \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square\" shows how the dream starts to fade during the Cultural Revolution in the '60s and '70s, when the Red Guards attack and destroy anything linked to the old Chinese culture. And how the dream is crushed when the tanks roll in Tiananmen Square. Wang fled China after the student uprising and now lives in Montreal, Quebec.  But he was in Beijing when he learned of his Oscar nomination. Even today his film can't be shown in China. But Wang hopes that one day that will change, and explosive subjects such as the Tiananmen Square massacre will no longer be taboo. Wang believes his film delivers a message that the tragedy at Tiananmen should never happen again. \"China doesn't need a revolution. The people here don't need another revolution. We have suffered so much since 100 years ago.\" \"It's time to enjoy life,\" Wang says.

The shooting comes a week after the shooting tragedy at Columbine high school in Littleton, Colorado. \"We have a son and daughter-in-law in Denver,\" says Pastor Gartly after an evening service at Taber Evangelical Free Church where worshipers discussed the day's tragic events. The dead teenager has been identified as Jason Lang, 17. The other victim, Shane Christmas, also 17, had emergency surgery yesterday at Lethbridge Regional Hospital. This morning his condition was reported as fair to serious. The two grade 11 students were said to be best friends. Eight thousand people live in Taber, which is 300 kilometres southeast of Calgary. Many members of the community are members of the Mormon Church or are evangelical Christians. Taber was founded at the beginning of the century. It is mainly made up of decendents of the area's early homestead pioneers, of Central European, Polish, Japanese, Dutch and various other racial backgrounds. Many Japanese came in 1943, Polish war veterans in 1947, and many Dutch immigrants came after about 1950.

Today he is in a Mexican hotel, waiting to find out when he will finally be allowed to fly back to Montreal. Pascal, who is 20, was released yesterday from the Chiapas state penitentiary of Cerro Hueco -- where he had staged a hunger strike to protest his arrest last September 28th. He was set free after relatives paid a $1,200 fine. Last fall Mexican prosecutors charged Pascal with stealing small clay figurines from the Palenque ruins. He was put in jail in January. A local judge found Hudon guilty of the theft charges. Under Mexican law, all pre-Hispanic artifacts are considered national treasures. \"He's very happy because he's returning to his country,\" his lawyer, Alphonso Herrera Gonzalez, said. \"He called me from a pay phone to say he was finally free,\" his mother, Jocelyne Dion, told the french language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal. \"He was shouting with joy.\" For the Mexican authorities, their fight to prevent the looting of Mexico's vast stash of historical treasures is far from resolved. \"Looting and the illegal export of archeological goods is fairly prevalent,\" says Joaquin Garcia, chairman of Mexico's archeology council. Mexico has about 200,000 archeological sites, and only about 150 are monitored constantly and open to the public, he said. \"It's quite difficult to take care of them. We depend much on the people who live near the sites.\" Although Mexico has had laws to prevent looting since the middle of the 19th century, Mexicans have become increasingly alarmed lately about losing their national heritage to looters, and have started to apply their laws with greater vigilance. Mr. Hudon was a prime example of the new get-tough attitude. The former college student was found carrying eight pieces of ceramics, which he said he found on a path in the bush near the Palenque historical site in southern Mexico. Mr. Hudon has said he had intended to hand over the pottery to authorities, but before he had a chance to do so, he was stopped by police. They searched him and charged him with illegally possessing artifacts. He was put in a federal prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas state in the south of Mexico at the beginning of January. At a trial in February, he was sentenced to a year in jail plus one month of labour, and told to pay $72,000 to the National Institute of History and Anthropology. His family and friends in Montreal protested, and Mr. Hudon went on a hunger strike. The Canadian embassy intervened, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spoke publicly about the need to get the young man out of prison in Chiapas. Last month, Mr. Hudon appealed the case. He was allowed to give a new statement through a translator. The judge ruled that he was not legally obliged to pay $72,000 to the institute, and lowered the fine to $2,500. Artifacts, some dating back tens of thousands of years, are frequently stolen when sites are discovered by excavators or through small-scale looting, he said. There has been looting at only three major projects in the past 15 years -- projects run by foreign experts. All three were halted and many artifacts recovered. Small-scale looting, however, has landed between 40 and 50 people in jail every year. And Mr. Garcia is sure much theft goes undetected. Despite his serious troubles, Pascal has not lost the urge to travel.

The virus is called \"Melissa.\" Melissa, identified by symbols that form a winking smiley face, usually contains the subject line, \"Important message,\" and the body says \"Here is that document you asked for ... don't show it to anyone else.\" The virus launches documents into cyberspace and can clog e-mail servers, security experts said yesterday. Users may think they are receiving e-mail from a friend because the virus takes real addresses out of a users own address books. Over the weekend, businesses and governments around the world were contacting experts to see if Melissa can be stopped. One team of virus experts is at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The university has a \"Computer Emergency Response Team.\"  Katherine Fithen is with the team. She says the Melissa e-mail should be considered a potential security breach. \"It's safe to say we're bracing ourselves,\" she says. The Melissa virus spreads via Microsoft's widely used Word 97 and Word 2000 documents, which can be attached to e-mail messages, as well as Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail program. If a computer user opens the infected Word document, the virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book and sends an infected message to the first 50 entries. People cannot get the virus by merely opening up a message, only by opening the attached document. REMEMBER, NEVER OPEN A DOCUMENT ATTACHMENT FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW. And now in this case, you can't even trust all the documents you receive from people you do know! Use common sense, and always be careful of anything that you receive via e-mail. Carnegie-Mellon's experts first learned of the virus Friday afternoon and its members worked through the night to analyze it. But the full reach of the virus may only become clear today when millions sit down at their computer terminals. Several antivirus software makers have posted patches on their Web sites to detect and reject the virus. People can also protect themselves by not opening the attachments, Ms. Fithen says. Ms. Fithen declined to say if any government's security was breached and wouldn't name anyone whose files had been damaged.

No man can live this life and emerge unchanged. He will carry, however faint, the imprint of the desert, the brand which marks the nomad; and he will have within him the yearning to return, weak or insistent according to his nature. For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can match.\" - T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) While adventurer Jamie Clarke was crossing the world s harshest desert, he often thought his 1997 trip up Mount Everest had been easier. \"I ll never cross the Rub al-Khaly again,\" said the adventurer from Calgary, Alberta of his 39-day trek across the Arabian desert. \"But I d climb Everest.\" Clarke spoke from the comfort of a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and recalled the desert s challenges: threatening quicksand, mountainous sand dunes and blazing heat. Halfway through the journey, Clarke thought his chances of completing the trek were slim. But he and his team fought frustration, thirst, sandstorms and a scorching sun to make the 1,200-km journey that took them from Oman, through Saudi Arabia and into the United Arab Emirates. Not only did the six-man, 12-camel team make it, they beat their own deadline by three days. \"We are tired, thirsty and hungry, but ecstatic to be here,\" Clarke said. Clarke and two other Calgary residents, his brother Leigh and friend Bruce Kirkby, set out Feb. 2 from Salalah, Oman, along with three Bedouin guides and their camels. On March 12, they reached Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. They became the first Westerners in more than fifty years to cross the severe Arabian desert. \"The first thing I did when I came to the hotel was open the tap and pour a glass of cold water,\" Clarke said. \"In the desert, you had to be really thirsty to drink water stored in goat skin.\" He described the stored water, which became contaminated with goat hair and fat, as tasting like \"watered chocolate milk.\" He marvels at how lucky we are to be able to drink from a tap. There are no permanent roads or settlements in the desert, which covers 300,000 square kilometres of southern Arabia. It has been a lure to adventurers since British traveller Wilfred Thesiger crossed it in 1947 and wrote about his journey. Daytime temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, with the sand even hotter: 80 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature fell as low as nine degrees. \"Before the journey, for months, all I thought about was being in the desert. I dreamt about it,\" Clarke said. \"When I got there, I couldn t wait to finish.\" Clarke said his relationship with the camels left an lasting mark on him. \"The camel became part of me. I became part of the camel. Listening to it, feeling it, becomes an extension of you because your life depends on it.\" He added that \"you have to be nice to it, you have to talk softly and show your love\" or you ll be trying to work with a grumpy, screaming beast. The trek left the men with blistered skin, chapped lips and less weight. Each lost at least 11 pounds. Clarke and his team sent reports and photos about their trip by satellite phone to a Web site that drew more than three million visitors. \"The kids were a great motivation, I felt they were cheering us on. \"I wouldn't advise someone to go there for 40 days.

Canada was one of the leading countries behind the ban. In Melbourne, Australia bells rang at Saint Michael's Uniting Church. In Brasilia, the capital city of Brazil, anti-landmine pamphlets were distributed and there were screenings of \"Spotlight on a Massacre\", an anti-landmines film in Portuguese. In Paris, France members of carillon associations - people who are experts at ringing bells - coordinated the ringing of cathedral bells across the city. And there was bell-ringing in approximately 30 Buddhist temples and Christian churches in 10 cities throughout Japan, including Hiroshima, Tokyo and Osaka. The pact was agreed to by 130 countries in Ottawa, Ontario in 1997. Russia, the United States, China and Ukraine did not sign the treaty. Despite these notable absences, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams, of The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, says the accord has an impact for many other countries in the world. The head of the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the treaty's entry into force as a milestone. \"It is a day whose arrival few could have predicted, and whose import to the millions whose lives or limbs may be saved from these barbarous weapons cannot be overestimated,\" Mr. Annan said. Pope John Paul added his voice to the effort, urging more countries to sign the treaty. The treaty prohibits the use, production and storage of anti-personnel landmines and sets a time limit for destroying stocks and clearing mine fields. There are two categories of landmines: antipersonnel (AP) and antitank or anti-vehicle (AT): -Anti-personnel (AP) landmine - \"A mine designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.\" -Anti-tank (AT) landmine - An AT mine is a device designed to detonate by more than 100 kilograms of pressure. AT mines cannot distinguish between a tank and tractor The United States has refused to sign the treaty, saying it needs the mines for its defence along the border between North and South Korea. The governments of North and South Korea have been in constant conflict for more then 40 years. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spearheaded the political initiative to get the treaty ratified. \"For us, this is a very important day,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said.

Measles is on track to being eliminated throughout North and South America by the turn of the millennium. At least that's the opinion of a number of health experts. Last year Canada had only 12 cases of measles, down from about 2,500 in 1995. \"It has been a surprise to me that measles has disappeared as quickly as it did,\" says Donald Henderson of the Pan American Health Organization. Most children who get measles will have a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. These symptoms last for 1 or 2 weeks. But measles also causes ear infections in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who get it. As many as 1 out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. And about 1 child in every 1,000 who get measles will get encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave the child deaf or mentally disabled. For every 1,000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth prematurely. Anti-measles immunization began in Canada in 1957. Before that virtually every child went through a bout with the disease. But the single-dose vaccine was not fully effective. In August 1995 an advisory committee recommended that all children be given a second dose of vaccine. The new policy was adopted in all provinces and territories. Rubella, commonly referred to as German measles, is a different disease with similar symptoms. It remains a problem and is one of the next targets for elimination. Measles is the latest in a string of successes for childhood vaccination programs, but experts fear they could be undermined by growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization. Last year a group of Manitoba parents went to court in an effort to block a program to immunize Grade Four students against Hepatitis B. They lost their court case, but many parents chose not to have their children vaccinated, says Robert Pless of the federal Laboratory Centre for Disease Control.", "qas": [{"question": "How many cases of measles were there in 1995 in Canada?", "id": "1999-W16-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "2,500", "answer_start": 316}]}, {"question": "When did Canadian children begin to receive anti-measles vaccinations?", "id": "1999-W16-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1957", "answer_start": 1138}]}, {"question": "What is Rubella?", "id": "1999-W16-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "German measles", "answer_start": 1465}, {"text": "a different disease with similar symptoms", "answer_start": 1484}]}, {"question": "Why do some parents not get their children vaccinated?", "id": "1999-W16-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization", "answer_start": 1724}]}, {"question": "Who tried to prevent Grade Four Students from being immunized against Hepatitis B?", "id": "1999-W16-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a group of Manitoba parents", "answer_start": 1809}]}, {"question": "Where does Donald Henderson work?", "id": "1999-W16-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Pan American Health Organization", "answer_start": 442}]}]}]}, {"title": "Canadian Superstars at the Grammys", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Canadian female music stars were among the big winners at last night's Grammy Awards show in Los Angeles, California.

Rap has been eclipsing rock as the dominant musical form for young people, and routinely produces best sellers. Much of the credit goes to Ms. Hill, a 23-year-old mother of two whose music mixes rap and R and touches on family and political issues. She had won two earlier Grammys with the Fugees. Shania Twain, Stevie Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian Setzer Orchestra each were double winners Wednesday night. Sheryl Crow won for best rock album, and Madonna also picked up her first musical Grammy, including best pop album for her excursion into electronica, \"Ray of Light\".

Yalnizyan also noted that Albertans are extremely competitive, and have a \" law of the jungle\" view of life. It's this outlook of, `If you can get it, keep it. And if you're not getting it, then you're a loser,''' Ms. Yalnizyan said Thursday during a speech. Yalnizyan added that she did not hear that type of thinking in too many places in Canada. Yalnizyan's report is for the Centre For Social Justice in Toronto. It uses Statistics Canada figures to look at growing income differences between Canada's rich and poor. When Yalnizyan looked at the Alberta data, she discovered that while Alberta's economy is growing, the difference between the rich and poor is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else in Canada. The difference is most noticeable in Calgary where the city's prosperity has meant more high-paying management jobs, but also more unstable and low-paying part-time work. Yalnizyan feels that attitudes are as much to blame for this inequality as government spending cuts, a low minimum wage and the spread of part-time jobs. She argues that cultural expectations are one of the first factors shaping the way the labour market performs. One example, she said, is Albertans' enthusiasm for tax cuts even though the province's health care and education systems are in bad shape, and need tax money to be improved. \"There's a kind of sky's-the-limit attitude.

Some Newfoundlanders marked the occasion by re-creating the vote that brought the province into Canada. The town of Saint Anthony staged a referendum during the last 10 days but with a different result than that of half a century ago. This time the \"No\" side won by a slim margin. Of the 934 people who cast ballots, 53 per cent opposed joining Canada. In fact, the referendum also mirrors history. The first time Newfoundlanders voted in 1948 they rejected union with Canada. It was only in the second vote that Newfoundlanders said \"yes\". It's a result many Newfoundlanders and their politicians have wondered about over the years. Where would Newfoundland be today if the referendum results had been reversed and 52 per cent of voters chose independence? Newfoundlander John Crosbie was a minister in the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.  He thinks the province may have been all right on its own. \"It is highly likely we would have survived,\" Crosbie said. \"It would have been a lot more work and more difficult, but it wouldn't have been necessarily a disaster had we continued as an independent dominion.\" But Mr. Crosbie does recognize the benefits of the union. \"Our quality of life is better here today because people have a basic level of security,\" he says. Mr. Crosbie says a number of federal government programs like unemployment insurance and aid packages to fishers who are out of work are just a few of the reasons Newfoundlanders should count their blessings. Newfoundland was granted full British colonial status in the early 19th century. The Royal Navy began escorting ships to the Grand Banks fishing grounds for the summer fishing season and soon developed seasonal communities along the coast. As permanent settlements formed, civil governors replaced fishing admirals and colonial political institutions were set up. Newfoundland s first popularly elected legislative assembly convened in Saint John s in 1832. In the decades that followed, the colony was run by representative government, and later, responsible government in 1855. The population was also strongly divided by religion -- half were Protestant, half Roman Catholic. By the turn of the century, Newfoundland was a self-governing colony that played a small role in international affairs. But life in small communities dotting the coast -- called outports -- was rough. Poverty, starvation and disease were rampant. By the end of the Second World War, union with Canada was once again being mentioned. Newfoundlanders were swept up in a passionate debate between a pro-union movement called the Confederates and an anti-union movement that wanted Newfoundland to have what was called \"responsible government\", that is, to remain independent from Canada. A vote was held on July 22, 1948. On the morning of July 23, 1948, Newfoundlanders awoke to hear that the Confederates had won. It was a tight race: the pro-confederates received 52.3 per cent of the vote with responsible government getting 47.7 per cent. Newfoundland was on its way to becoming Canada s tenth province. A gala concert caps Newfoundland's celebrations this evening with guests on both sides of the unity debate. Both Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard will join in the festivities of the nationally televised event.", "qas": [{"question": "When did Newfoundland become a British colony?", "id": "1999-W14-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the early 19th century", "answer_start": 1738}]}, {"question": "Who governed the early costal communities before civil governors replaced them?", "id": "1999-W14-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "fishing admirals", "answer_start": 1979}]}, {"question": "What factor divided the population of Newfoundland in the 1800s?", "id": "1999-W14-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "religion", "answer_start": 2305}, {"text": "half were Protestant, half Roman Catholic", "answer_start": 2317}]}, {"question": "What date was the vote that made Newfoundland part of Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "July 22, 1948", "answer_start": 2964}]}, {"question": "How many people cast their votes for the \"responsible government\" in the final vote that made Newfoundland part of Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "47.7 percent", "answer_start": 3186}]}, {"question": "What were the pro-union Newfoundlanders called?", "id": "1999-W14-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Confederates", "answer_start": 2786}]}, {"question": "According to Mr. Crosbie, why do Newfoundlanders enjoy a better quality of life as a province of Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "people have a basic level of security", "answer_start": 1423}, {"text": "unemployment insurance and aid packages to fishers who are out of work", "answer_start": 1534}]}, {"question": "Who was prime minister when John Crosbie was a minister?", "id": "1999-W14-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Brian Mulroney", "answer_start": 1028}]}, {"question": "Where did Newfoundlanders recently re-create the vote that brought the province into Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "town of Saint Anthony", "answer_start": 286}, {"text": "Saint Anthony", "answer_start": 294}]}]}]}, {"title": "Refugees Arrive in Nova Scotia", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A second planeload of refugees from Kosovo landed in Canada early this morning. The 264 people are among the first of the 5,000 people of Albanian heritage from the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo who will be coming to Canada. The refugees have been living in tents in the Stenkovac refugee camp in Macedonia since they left Yugoslavia. The plane touched down at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia, at 1 a.m. local time, 10 hours behind schedule. The tired Albanians put on smiles for Red Cross volunteers and military officials. They told waiting reporters they were grateful for the safety Canada provides, but it was clear many will spend their time in Canada dreaming of returning home. On hand to greet his countrymen was Burnaby, British Columbia resident Shamsay Amoosa. Mr. Amoosa fled his homeland six years ago - from a civil war that few outside the country then paid attention to. \"Canada is a good country,\" Amoosa told the refugees. \"You will be safe here until things are better at home and then we will help you go back if you want.\" Ahmet Konyoury, who was on the plane with his wife and youngest daughter, said he didn't want to leave Kosovo. Rather, he had no choice. \"People over there, like Serbian military, said 'You like NATO, go there,' 'You like Clinton, go there,'\" he told CBC News through a translator. The Konyourys were one of the lucky ones who made it to Canada. At the filthy and overcrowded camps on Wednesday, thousands of refugees waited anxiously to hear their names called for overbooked flights to Canada. Officials had overbooked the plane after some families changed their mind at the last minute and didn't show up for the first flight. But on Wednesday, almost all the families lined up for the flight -- plus some. That meant delays as officials tried to sort out who would go and who must stay. Like the Konyourys -- and the refugees who wait still -- each person, each family, has a story about their plight, and their hopes for the future. The United Nations says the Kosovo refugee crisis could grow by another half million. Here are the numbers so far: 17,000 refugees in Bosnia, 62,000 in Montenegro, 404,000 in Albania, and 211,000 in Macedonia. There seems to be some movement towards putting an end to the war in Yugoslavia. The world's major powers may be close to a diplomatic breakthrough to end the conflict. The Group of Eight nations, including Russia, the United States, and Canada, have agreed to a seven-point plan to find peace in Kosovo, including the basic terms of an international force to secure the return of refugees. The plan must now be approved by the United Nations Security Council, which represents 185 countries from all over the world.

The kids are named Clint, Arnold and Danny. This first Canadian cloning could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of injuries like broken limbs and torn human tissues. The company used the same technology invented by Scottish scientists to clone Dolly the sheep in 1997. Cloning is the first step in a process that could ultimately lead to the mass production of a material known as BioSteel. Biosteel is an artificial spider silk developed by Nexia Biotechnologies. Company president Jeffrey Turner says the silk can be used in tissue repair, neurosurgery and sutures, and to create artificial tendons and ligaments, among other uses. Nexia aims to extract the spider silk from goat's milk. While nobody has yet made a fabric from biosteel, Mr. Turner is convinced the protein can be turned into a supermaterial because of its natural role in the silk of a spider's web. \"When you think of what a web has to do, its extreme strength makes perfect sense,\" he says. The silken threads of the web must be nearly invisible to prey and yet be able to bring a fly to a screeching halt. Clint, Arnold and Danny were born in March. To clone the triplet goats, a nucleus with a mass of cells from a source goat was placed in a petri dish and cultured. One of these cells was then implanted into a mature, unfertilized egg. This replaced the egg's original DNA, which had been removed. This process was done three times, each time using the same source cells. The eggs were then placed into two recipient mothers, with one female carrying two eggs, and the other the third. Because cells were taken from the same source, the three kids have exactly the same genetic makeup. The potential to mass-produce BioSteel is a main reason the animals were cloned in the first place. Mr. Turner says that BioSteel is the strongest substance known to man, with a tensile strength of 300,000 pounds per square inch. BioSteel is an artificial spider silk that is environmentally friendly, extremely strong and light, and compatible with the human body, says Mr. Turner. The company hopes eventually to extract this spider silk from goat's milk. Turner said the company will soon clone a sheep with the spider-silk gene in its genetic makeup. In the past year, the company tried injecting a spider-silk gene directly into the goat. But that system wasn't efficient enough. It worked on only four goats in a hundred. The new method could have close to a 100-per-cent success rate. Next year the company will clone another goat that will carry the spider-silk gene in its chromosomes. The silk protein can be extracted from the goat when it starts to produce milk. Turner said Nexia will clone only about three or four goats with the spider-silk protein. They can then reproduce with normal goats, and their offspring will still have the spider-silk gene in their bodies. But Clint, Arnold and Danny aren't making everyone happy. Some animal-rights activists and ethicists oppose the concept of cloning living beings. Professor Margaret Somerville says she does not agree with cloning for the purposes of creating a superior race of animals -- such as faster race horses or stronger elephants. However, she sees an argument in cloning animals \"for valid, justified purposes.\" The debate around cloning animals, food products and even human beings is growing all across the world. It means that lawmakers are having to sit down to decide what should be allowed, and what should be made illegal.", "qas": [{"question": "When was a sheep cloned by Scottish scientists?", "id": "1999-W18-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1997", "answer_start": 337}]}, {"question": "What type of animal did Nexia Biotechnologies clone?", "id": "1999-W18-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "goats", "answer_start": 62}]}, {"question": "How many clones did Nexia Biotechnologies make?", "id": "1999-W18-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "three", "answer_start": 1471}]}, {"question": "Who is the president of Nexia Biotechnologies ?", "id": "1999-W18-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Jeffrey Turner", "answer_start": 557}]}, {"question": "Besides being very strong, what are the advantages of BioSteel?", "id": "1999-W18-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "environmentally friendly, extremely light, and compatible with the human body", "answer_start": 2060}]}]}]}, {"title": "UN says Canada number one", "paragraphs": [{"context": "For the sixth year in a row, the United Nations has ranked Canada as the best country in the world to live in.

Camille Laurin was 76. He had been ill with cancer. Dr. Laurin was a psychiatrist who became active in Quebec politics during the 1960's. He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly, Quebec's legislative assembly,  in 1970. Dr. Camille Laurin once described his beloved language law as the \"re-conquest\" of Quebec. He was referring to the history of Quebec. During the 18th and 19th century, French-speaking Quebecers were often ruled by governments that were controlled by England. Many French-speaking Quebecers considered themselves to have been conquered by \"les anglais\" - the English. By the 1950's French-speaking Quebecers were increasingly convinced that the only way to stand up for their own rights was for Quebec to become an independent country, separate from Canada. Camille Laurin was among them. Bill 101 required signs in Quebec to be in French. Before Bill 101 became law many signs in Quebec were only in English, even though the majority of the population is French speaking. Bill 101 also required the children of immigrants to go to French schools. Many French-speaking Quebecers were worried that immigrants would choose English schools for their children. That would mean that the French language would slowly die away. Many English-speaking Quebecers did not like Bill 101 because they felt it took away their freedom to put up English signs. They also disagreed with the government telling immigrants which schools they must attend. Bill 101 came into effect in 1977. For many years it was big news in Quebec as there were many demonstrations - both from people who supported the bill and from those who hated it. One thing was never in question, however, was Dr. Laurin's passionate love of Quebec. \"Dr. Laurin was a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined,\" says Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature. Liberal opposition Leader Jean Charest praised his protection of the French language. \"He was a man who was devoted to the interests of Quebec  and in that sense today is a day of sadness for us.\" To some in the English-language community, Laurin symbolized francophones who wanted to crush the anglophone minority. William Johnson, a hardline English-rights activist, said he was personally saddened by the death of his ideological opponent. \"He was very cultivated man, with a seductive charm.\" But the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby condemned Laurin's masterwork as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada. Bill 101 is credited by Quebec nationalists as helping preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America. Dr. Laurin made no apologies for the law's toughness, saying the law simply reflected Quebec's demographic reality. Although it meant a lower profile for anglophones and less clout after years of predominance, Laurin said it took away no basic rights and recognized their institutions, schools and media.", "qas": [{"question": "What is Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Quebec's very controversial language law", "answer_start": 72}]}, {"question": "What does Bill 101 require?", "id": "1999-W11-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "signs in Quebec to be in French", "answer_start": 956}, {"text": "immigrant children to attend French schools", "answer_start": 1161}]}, {"question": "Who described Dr. Laurin as \"a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined\"?", "id": "1999-W11-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature", "answer_start": 1929}, {"text": "Francois Gendron", "answer_start": 1929}]}, {"question": "When did Bill 101 come into effect?", "id": "1999-W11-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1977", "answer_start": 1614}]}, {"question": "How does the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby describe Laurin's masterwork, Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada", "answer_start": 2595}]}, {"question": "How do Quebec nationalists credit Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as helping preserve the French language", "answer_start": 2691}, {"text": "as helping to preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America", "answer_start": 2702}]}]}]}, {"title": "No Union for Montreal McDonald's", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Workers at a McDonald's restaurant in Montreal, Quebec have voted against becoming members of a trade union. There is only one unionized McDonald's restaurant in North America. It is in Squamish, British Columbia. About 90 per cent of the outlet's 55 workers voted against unionizing. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters had been trying to organize the workers for 16 months. Rejean Lavigne, head of the Teamsters local behind the campaign, said almost all of the original employees who signed union cards in 1997 had quit and the new ones, some as young as 16, didn't want a union. \"If we lose, well, we can't do anything more,\" Lavigne said before the vote was tallied. \"If the employees don't want us there, what are you going to do?\" A statement from McDonald's Quebec regional office welcomed the vote. \"We believe that giving all the employees in the outlet the opportunity to determine the outcome of this matter was the fairest and most responsible way to resolve the question of union representation,\" the statement said.

Rejection of the union in Montreal was the second failure for the Teamsters against the chain. Last year, a franchise in suburban St-Hubert, Quebec shut down just as the union was about to be certified. The latest loss means an end to a campaign begun last year to unionize at least one McDonald's in every major city across Canada, which has so far cost the Teamsters about $100,000.
