Hundreds of fans camped out for hours to get choice seats for the premiere of the much-anticipated film. The St. John's fans were among the first in the world to see \"Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace.\" Midnight arrives in Newfoundland a half-hour before the rest of eastern North America. Advance tickets for the first two days of round-the-clock showings went on sale last week and were quickly snapped up. In cities across Canada fans began lining up for tickets in late April. In Montreal someone actually slept in a tent out on the sidewalk in front of a movie theatre to make sure he got the first ticket. Mark Churchill and Ken Green were at the St. John's screening. Mark says it's \"definitely a five star movie.\" Ken says, \"the story was awesome, the effects were top notch, and even the acting was well done.\" Some Star Wars fans from Iceland were so anxious to see the movie, they flew to Halifax for the showing. Otherwise, they would to have had to wait several months for its Icelandic release. And as if shelling out up to $9 for a Star War's ticket isn't bad enough: How about $50 or more? It's what some scalpers are asking in Los Angeles, California. \"It's horrible,\" said Tom Sherak, who helps distribute the film. \"This is just what we didn't want.\" When tickets went on sale each customer was limited to 12 tickets, although there has been no formal way to stop scalpers from returning to snag more tickets. Offers for tickets have been common on the Internet. There were examples of tickets getting bids for double or triple their face value. One seller got a bid of $89.99 for two $8.50 tickets for Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, or roughly five times the face price. As for the critics, well, as expected they are divided. In the Toronto Star, Geoff Pevere says \"If you don't forgive the narrative gaps and inconsistencies... you forget them when the movie's breathtaking digital set pieces kick in. And if you don't, you're in the wrong movie.\" In the National Post, Stephen Cole says, \"...it's a piece that's missing, specifically the presence of a larger-than-life villain, that prevents Lucas's new film from truly succeeding as epic entertainment.\" And Liz Braun in the Toronto Suns says, \"fans... will not be disappointed, and those non-fans who expect nothing from the film will be pleasantly surprised.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Episode 1 The Phantom Menace\" movie?", "id": "1999-W21-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "late April", "answer_start": 553}]}, {"question": "Why did someone sleep in a tent on a sidewalk in front of a theater in Montreal?", "id": "1999-W21-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to make sure he got the first ticket", "answer_start": 658}]}, {"question": "How did Mark Churchill describe the movie, \"The Phantom Menace\"?", "id": "1999-W21-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"definitely a five-star movie\"", "answer_start": 774}]}, {"question": "Who said \"the effects were top notch\" when he was talking about \"The Phantom Menace\"?", "id": "1999-W21-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ken Green", "answer_start": 715}]}, {"question": "How much money are some scalpers in Los Angeles asking for a Phantom Menace ticket?", "id": "1999-W21-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "$50 or more", "answer_start": 1177}]}, {"question": "Where have offers for tickets been common?", "id": "1999-W21-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "on the Internet", "answer_start": 1549}]}, {"question": "What does Stephen Cole of the National Post say is missing in the Phantom Menace?", "id": "1999-W21-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"the presence of a larger-than-life villain\"", "answer_start": 2151}, {"text": "a larger-than-life villain", "answer_start": 2163}]}]}]}, {"title": "Students and Clinton want Stricter Gun Control", "paragraphs": [{"context": "American President Bill Clinton wants tougher gun control in the United States On Thursday, he had some help.

Camille Laurin was 76. He had been ill with cancer. Dr. Laurin was a psychiatrist who became active in Quebec politics during the 1960's. He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly, Quebec's legislative assembly,  in 1970. Dr. Camille Laurin once described his beloved language law as the \"re-conquest\" of Quebec. He was referring to the history of Quebec. During the 18th and 19th century, French-speaking Quebecers were often ruled by governments that were controlled by England. Many French-speaking Quebecers considered themselves to have been conquered by \"les anglais\" - the English. By the 1950's French-speaking Quebecers were increasingly convinced that the only way to stand up for their own rights was for Quebec to become an independent country, separate from Canada. Camille Laurin was among them. Bill 101 required signs in Quebec to be in French. Before Bill 101 became law many signs in Quebec were only in English, even though the majority of the population is French speaking. Bill 101 also required the children of immigrants to go to French schools. Many French-speaking Quebecers were worried that immigrants would choose English schools for their children. That would mean that the French language would slowly die away. Many English-speaking Quebecers did not like Bill 101 because they felt it took away their freedom to put up English signs. They also disagreed with the government telling immigrants which schools they must attend. Bill 101 came into effect in 1977. For many years it was big news in Quebec as there were many demonstrations - both from people who supported the bill and from those who hated it. One thing was never in question, however, was Dr. Laurin's passionate love of Quebec. \"Dr. Laurin was a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined,\" says Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature. Liberal opposition Leader Jean Charest praised his protection of the French language. \"He was a man who was devoted to the interests of Quebec  and in that sense today is a day of sadness for us.\" To some in the English-language community, Laurin symbolized francophones who wanted to crush the anglophone minority. William Johnson, a hardline English-rights activist, said he was personally saddened by the death of his ideological opponent. \"He was very cultivated man, with a seductive charm.\" But the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby condemned Laurin's masterwork as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada. Bill 101 is credited by Quebec nationalists as helping preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America. Dr. Laurin made no apologies for the law's toughness, saying the law simply reflected Quebec's demographic reality. Although it meant a lower profile for anglophones and less clout after years of predominance, Laurin said it took away no basic rights and recognized their institutions, schools and media.", "qas": [{"question": "What is Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Quebec's very controversial language law", "answer_start": 72}]}, {"question": "What does Bill 101 require?", "id": "1999-W11-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "signs in Quebec to be in French", "answer_start": 956}, {"text": "immigrant children to attend French schools", "answer_start": 1161}]}, {"question": "Who described Dr. Laurin as \"a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined\"?", "id": "1999-W11-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature", "answer_start": 1929}, {"text": "Francois Gendron", "answer_start": 1929}]}, {"question": "When did Bill 101 come into effect?", "id": "1999-W11-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1977", "answer_start": 1614}]}, {"question": "How does the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby describe Laurin's masterwork, Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada", "answer_start": 2595}]}, {"question": "How do Quebec nationalists credit Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as helping preserve the French language", "answer_start": 2691}, {"text": "as helping to preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America", "answer_start": 2702}]}]}]}, {"title": "Canadians Triumph Over Harsh Desert", "paragraphs": [{"context": "\"Bedouin ways are hard, even for those brought up in them and for strangers, terrible: a death in life. No man can live this life and emerge unchanged.

For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can match.\" - T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) While adventurer Jamie Clarke was crossing the world s harshest desert, he often thought his 1997 trip up Mount Everest had been easier. \"I ll never cross the Rub al-Khaly again,\" said the adventurer from Calgary, Alberta of his 39-day trek across the Arabian desert. \"But I d climb Everest.\" Clarke spoke from the comfort of a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and recalled the desert s challenges: threatening quicksand, mountainous sand dunes and blazing heat. Halfway through the journey, Clarke thought his chances of completing the trek were slim. But he and his team fought frustration, thirst, sandstorms and a scorching sun to make the 1,200-km journey that took them from Oman, through Saudi Arabia and into the United Arab Emirates. Not only did the six-man, 12-camel team make it, they beat their own deadline by three days. \"We are tired, thirsty and hungry, but ecstatic to be here,\" Clarke said. Clarke and two other Calgary residents, his brother Leigh and friend Bruce Kirkby, set out Feb. 2 from Salalah, Oman, along with three Bedouin guides and their camels. On March 12, they reached Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. They became the first Westerners in more than fifty years to cross the severe Arabian desert. \"The first thing I did when I came to the hotel was open the tap and pour a glass of cold water,\" Clarke said. \"In the desert, you had to be really thirsty to drink water stored in goat skin.\" He described the stored water, which became contaminated with goat hair and fat, as tasting like \"watered chocolate milk.\" He marvels at how lucky we are to be able to drink from a tap. There are no permanent roads or settlements in the desert, which covers 300,000 square kilometres of southern Arabia. It has been a lure to adventurers since British traveller Wilfred Thesiger crossed it in 1947 and wrote about his journey. Daytime temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, with the sand even hotter: 80 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature fell as low as nine degrees. \"Before the journey, for months, all I thought about was being in the desert. I dreamt about it,\" Clarke said. \"When I got there, I couldn t wait to finish.\" Clarke said his relationship with the camels left an lasting mark on him. \"The camel became part of me. I became part of the camel. Listening to it, feeling it, becomes an extension of you because your life depends on it.\" He added that \"you have to be nice to it, you have to talk softly and show your love\" or you ll be trying to work with a grumpy, screaming beast. The trek left the men with blistered skin, chapped lips and less weight. Each lost at least 11 pounds. Clarke and his team sent reports and photos about their trip by satellite phone to a Web site that drew more than three million visitors. \"The kids were a great motivation, I felt they were cheering us on. \"I wouldn't advise someone to go there for 40 days.

They believe the Canadian wrestler's costume had something to do with the tragedy. The accident happened Sunday at a World Wrestling Federation event. Owen Hart was being lowered into the ring from the rafters of the arena. Police say Mr. Hart's cape may have been tangled with the release cord on his harness, causing it to release too early. Mr. Hart fell 18 metres into the ring. Mr. Hart's brother Ron blames the accident on the Wrestling Federation's constant search for more spectacular stunts and the desire to attract more television viewers. The WWF says the stunt will never be performed again. It seems it takes more than a full nelson or a vicious body slam to impress the rabid pro wrestling fans of the '90s. \"Frankly, wrestling was getting so far out and my poor brother Owen was a sacrifice for the television ratings,\" says Owen's sister Ellie Hart. Yesterday brother Bret \"Hitman\" Hart, also a wrestler, told an American televison network that Owen was uneasy about the stunt, \"but somehow over the weekend he got talked into doing it again.\" \"We're professional wrestlers,\" Bret Hart said. \"We take our falls on the mat, inside the ring. \"I was never a stuntman, and my brother Owen was never a stuntman.\" Keith Pelley, who is vice-president of programming for the Canadian television network TSN (which carries wrestling), says the WWF's ratings are among his network's highest. TSN carries the WWF's Raw is War show every week. \"The WWF and curling are probably our two highest-rated shows. You would be surprised by how many closet wrestling fans there are. The average viewer is 18 to 49, with the 34 to 49 age group being very dominant.\" Wrestling is now so mainstream that a former star Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of the American state of Minnesota, and Hulk Hogan is considering running for president of the United States. But that has not stopped many people from questioning the violent nature of the sport and wondering if more restrictions should not be put on when it is aired. Wrestling is one of the world's oldest sports. There are dozens of varieties practiced all over the world, from Sumo wrestling in Japan to Greco-Roman wrestling practiced in Europe. Professional wrestling has nothing to do with amateur wrestling.

And it's got nothing to do with what students are watching in their spare time at home. It's about teens having to watch commercials in school. Every day. It's a controversy about the growing commercialization of schools. Youth News Network, a private news and current-affairs network, has installed a satellite dish and thousands of dollars worth of televisions and audio-visual equipment at Meadowvale Secondary School free of charge. It expects to start broadcasting its 12-minute newscast -- complete with 2 1/2 minutes of commercials -- every day to the school's 1,700 students starting in September. But along with the bonanza of technology, the school is inheriting a political hot potato. \"I happen to believe that it is completely unacceptable to sell off little bits of our kids,\" said Heather-Jane Robertson, director of professional development with the Canadian Teachers Federation. \"If we don't understand that it's wrong to sell off our kids to advertisers, to compromise public education in that way, then we can hardly turn around and blame the people who want to make money off our stupidity.\" Some educators say YNN serves as an example of the wave of commercialization sweeping over schools at a time when funding cuts are forcing public boards to look to businesses for help. While public broadcasters such as CBC Newsworld and TV Ontario provide programming free of charge to schools, none can come close to providing the wealth of televisions, VCRs, computers, and video cameras installed at Meadowvale under its pilot project with YNN's owner, Montreal-based Athena Educational Partners Inc. Meadowvale principal Laurie Pedwell conceded that the technology was part of YNN's appeal. But she insisted that the sample broadcast viewed by students last November was balanced and suitably tailored to teenagers. As for the advertisements, she said none was offensive or aggressively pushing a product, and most depicted teenagers positively. The school has a June deadline to decide whether it wants to sign a five-year contract with YNN. Stephanie Lake is a grade twelve student at Meadowvale secondary. She recently wrote this essay about YNN coming to her school. \"We may be teenagers, but we're not all couch potatoes!  Well, at least we weren't. Who knows, maybe one day soon, secondary school students all across Canada will be the same - walking, brainwashed zombies.  The blame for this can be placed squarely on the shoulders of YNN and the governors of our education system. Trust the government. I don't think so! I am upset with the administration of my school for using us, the students, as guinea pigs, in a test which uses televisions inappropriately in my school.

The kids are named Clint, Arnold and Danny. This first Canadian cloning could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of injuries like broken limbs and torn human tissues. The company used the same technology invented by Scottish scientists to clone Dolly the sheep in 1997. Cloning is the first step in a process that could ultimately lead to the mass production of a material known as BioSteel. Biosteel is an artificial spider silk developed by Nexia Biotechnologies. Company president Jeffrey Turner says the silk can be used in tissue repair, neurosurgery and sutures, and to create artificial tendons and ligaments, among other uses. Nexia aims to extract the spider silk from goat's milk. While nobody has yet made a fabric from biosteel, Mr. Turner is convinced the protein can be turned into a supermaterial because of its natural role in the silk of a spider's web. \"When you think of what a web has to do, its extreme strength makes perfect sense,\" he says. The silken threads of the web must be nearly invisible to prey and yet be able to bring a fly to a screeching halt. Clint, Arnold and Danny were born in March. To clone the triplet goats, a nucleus with a mass of cells from a source goat was placed in a petri dish and cultured. One of these cells was then implanted into a mature, unfertilized egg. This replaced the egg's original DNA, which had been removed. This process was done three times, each time using the same source cells. The eggs were then placed into two recipient mothers, with one female carrying two eggs, and the other the third. Because cells were taken from the same source, the three kids have exactly the same genetic makeup. The potential to mass-produce BioSteel is a main reason the animals were cloned in the first place. Mr. Turner says that BioSteel is the strongest substance known to man, with a tensile strength of 300,000 pounds per square inch. BioSteel is an artificial spider silk that is environmentally friendly, extremely strong and light, and compatible with the human body, says Mr. Turner. The company hopes eventually to extract this spider silk from goat's milk. Turner said the company will soon clone a sheep with the spider-silk gene in its genetic makeup. In the past year, the company tried injecting a spider-silk gene directly into the goat. But that system wasn't efficient enough. It worked on only four goats in a hundred. The new method could have close to a 100-per-cent success rate. Next year the company will clone another goat that will carry the spider-silk gene in its chromosomes. The silk protein can be extracted from the goat when it starts to produce milk. Turner said Nexia will clone only about three or four goats with the spider-silk protein. They can then reproduce with normal goats, and their offspring will still have the spider-silk gene in their bodies. But Clint, Arnold and Danny aren't making everyone happy. Some animal-rights activists and ethicists oppose the concept of cloning living beings.

However, she sees an argument in cloning animals \"for valid, justified purposes.\" The debate around cloning animals, food products and even human beings is growing all across the world.

For days the air in towns like Iqaluit will be filled with the sounds of banging hammers and ripping cardboard as the goods they ordered from southern Canada finally arrive by ship. Mild temperatures across the eastern Arctic have produced ideal conditions for the 1999 sealift, moving sailing schedules for many communities forward by several weeks. Environment Canada is forecasting early ice break-up as shippers prepare to carry out the annual resupply of building materials, non-perishable food, cars, snowmobiles and boats. During the long winter months food supplies can only arrive by airplane. Food can cost from twice to three times what it does down south. Northerners are used to paying more than two dollars for a can of pop, more than a dollar for an apple and three dollars for a litre of milk. Believe it or not, a simple head of wilted lettuce can cost five dollars. But large, heavy items cannot be transported by airplane. So northern residents order what they need by catalogue or telephone or the Internet, and wait for the ships to arrive in the spring. \"El Nino as you know lasted well into the winter last year, and we've had above normal temperatures the whole winter in the eastern Arctic and Hudson Bay,\" says Rick Power, a spokesman for the Canadian Ice Service. \"So the ice didn't thicken as much as normal in most areas, and it started to clear a little earlier. \"And of course we've had a very mild spring as well.\" Environment Canada's outlook for ice break-up and clearing patterns predicts smooth sailing in much of James Bay, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait by the first week of July -- a month earlier than normal. Across the Arctic, ice break-up is expected to be three weeks early, on average. Colin Crosbie, vice-president of Nunavut Ocean Transport, and veteran of the northern sealift, described this year's ice conditions as unprecedented. \"I have been involved in shipping in the Arctic since 1969 and certainly nobody I've talked to who had been up there for decades before had ever seen anything like this,\" he says. \"Five years ago, if we had said we were going to Iqaluit June 25 people would say, 'you're crazy.'\" The extended sealift season is a blessing for the booming construction industry in Nunavut, Canada's newest territory. This year, Iqaluit is very scarce on materials, so the fact that it's going to open up early is a positive thing,\" says Suzanne Paquin, vice-president of Nunavut Eastern Arctic Shipping said.", "qas": [{"question": "Why will this year's sealift to northern Canada start early?", "id": "1999-W24-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "early ice break-up", "answer_start": 521}, {"text": "ice break-up is expected to be three weeks early", "answer_start": 1803}]}, {"question": "Why can't all supplies just be flown to northern Canada?", "id": "1999-W24-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "large, heavy items cannot be transported by airplane", "answer_start": 1024}]}, {"question": "How much can a can of pop cost in northern Canada?", "id": "1999-W24-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than two dollars", "answer_start": 835}]}, {"question": "What does a litre of milk cost in northern Canada?", "id": "1999-W24-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "three dollars", "answer_start": 911}]}, {"question": "When did Colin Crosbie become involved in shipping in the Arctic?", "id": "1999-W24-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 2069}]}, {"question": "Where is Iqaluit?", "id": "1999-W24-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Baffin Island", "answer_start": 13}, {"text": "northern Canada", "answer_start": 804}]}, {"question": "Who is forecasting smooth sailing in much of James Bay, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait by the first week of July?", "id": "1999-W24-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Environment Canada", "answer_start": 487}]}]}]}, {"title": "\"The Great One\" Hangs Up His Skates", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Number Ninety-Nine retired from professional hockey yesterday afternoon, but less than 24 hours later he's not shying away from sports.

At four o'clock this afternoon, the player hockey fans say is probably the best the game has ever known, and that some people say is the greatest professional athlete ever will be... bowling. The revelation came late in yesterday's news conference. In front of hundreds of reporters from all over North America and Europe Wayne Gretzky announced that he was going to hit the 10-pin bowling lanes in New York City. \"I'm going to spend the afternoon with my teammates - a bowling party and I'm looking forward to it, I'm going to enjoy. I've only bowled in Canada and it's five pin, they tell me here its 10 pin. I don't know if I can lift the ball. \" Yesterday was an emotional day for Gretzky fans. With tears and typical grace, Wayne Gretzky skated away from professional hockey. It's the second time in three months that one of the world's premier athletes has chosen to retire. \"It was a tough game for me today,\" Mr. Gretzky said of his farewell from the sport he dominated for two decades. \"I wanted it to be a celebration. \"You know, this is not a passing on,\" he added, his eyes watery. \"This is a moving on.\" It was a moving scene as the sport's greatest player said goodbye. The National Hockey League also retired No. 99, which commissioner Gary Bettman announced would never be worn in the league again. Gretzky has been the National Hockey League's Michael Jordan -- an almost mythical figure that fans of all teams admired and packed arenas to see. Perhaps fittingly, Jordan himself appeared in a second-period video, telling Gretzky, \"Your golf game is not going to get better, so don't think that will help. Relax and enjoy being a dad.\" \"It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,\" said Mario Lemieux, the retired Pittsburgh Penguins centre. \"It's going to be very difficult for the National Hockey League to lose the best hockey player that ever played, and he's been such a great ambassador for the game for 20 years.\" In front of Lemieux sat Mark Messier - who played with Mr. Gretzky for the Edmonton Oilers - and many other former teammates and opponents who admired \"The Great One\". When the game was over (the Penguins won 2-1) Gretzky smiled through tears during four final laps of Madison Square Garden. He skated slowly enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be taken of the player who holds or shares 61 NHL records. Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the crowd, he touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was retiring, Number 99 was gone. \"I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,\" said Wayne Gretzky, 38, his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final skate. \"I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part of the game. \"But I've made the right decision.\" As he left the arena, Wayne's father and mother told him they were proud of him.", "qas": [{"question": "How long did Gretzky dominate the sport of hockey?", "id": "1999-W17-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "two decades", "answer_start": 1169}, {"text": "20 years", "answer_start": 2127}]}, {"question": "Who won the last game Gretzky played?", "id": "1999-W17-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Penguins", "answer_start": 2330}, {"text": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "answer_start": 1931}]}, {"question": "Where did Gretzky play his last hockey game?", "id": "1999-W17-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Madison Square Garden", "answer_start": 2407}]}, {"question": "Why will the number 99 never be worn again by a professional hockey player?", "id": "1999-W17-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it has been retired", "answer_start": 1510}, {"text": "it has been retired by the National Hockey League", "answer_start": 1371}]}, {"question": "When did Gretzky's parents tell him they were proud of him?", "id": "1999-W17-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as he left the arena", "answer_start": 3058}]}, {"question": "Why did Gretzky say he was \"devastated\"??", "id": "1999-W17-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because he will no longer be a hockey player", "answer_start": 2819}]}, {"question": "How will Wayne Gretzky be competing again?", "id": "1999-W17-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "bowling", "answer_start": 370}, {"text": "bowling at a party with teammates", "answer_start": 2096}]}, {"question": "What did Gretzky do when he saw a youngster's hand extended from the crowd?", "id": "1999-W17-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he touched it", "answer_start": 2610}]}, {"question": "Who played with Gretzky on the Edmonton Oilers?", "id": "1999-W17-1-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Mark Messier", "answer_start": 2162}]}]}]}, {"title": "Julie At Work", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Over the weekend Canadian astronaut Julie Payette did not get a lot of time to put on her red clown nose and listen to the Sarah McLaughlan CD she brought along.

Though it was cold and noisy, space shuttle Discovery astronauts were overjoyed over the weekend when they swung open the hatches to the International Space Station. Shuttle commander Kent Rominger likened the visit to checking in to a \"fantastic hotel,\" with one major exception: \"Right now there's not a space toilet on board, so that makes living here permanently kind of tough.\" Astronaut Tamara Jernigan and Russian crewmate Valery Tokarev led the way inside the unfinished station yesterday evening. \"We are absolutely delighted to be aboard,\" Ms. Jernigan said as she and Mr. Tokarev floated aboard. \"Make yourself at home,\" Mission Control told the seven-member crew. But their welcome quickly gave way to work early today. Inside the Russian-built Zarya control module, Valery Tokarev and Canadian astronaut Julie Payette pulled up the floor and began changing electrical meters on batteries that aren't charging properly. Astronauts Rick Husband and Daniel Barry replaced two electronics boxes for a communication system inside the American Unity chamber, where it was a brisk 14 degrees. The system, which allows ground controllers to transmit and receive commands from the station, had been broken since mid-April but fired up quickly once the repairs were made. \"Your hard work has paid off!\" Mission Control radioed up. \"Well that's super news,\" Mr. Husband replied. Earlier, the crew installed insulation around some fans inside Zarya to reduce the noise level, which Mr. Barry said measured up to 67 decibels. Station officials hoped the mufflers would reduce the noise level to about 60 decibels -- about the same as an office environment. \"It is a little bit noisy in there.\" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's launch. \"In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,\" Mission Control's Milt Heflin explains.

Nanson said Tyrell s only source of information is his father, who won t permit his son to speak alone with a medical doctor. Nanson also said that Tyrell wouldn t think of disobeying his father. A psychiatrist who talked to Tyrell to find out what he knew about his condition told the court that the boy hasn t received enough medical information.

Measles is on track to being eliminated throughout North and South America by the turn of the millennium. At least that's the opinion of a number of health experts. Last year Canada had only 12 cases of measles, down from about 2,500 in 1995. \"It has been a surprise to me that measles has disappeared as quickly as it did,\" says Donald Henderson of the Pan American Health Organization. Most children who get measles will have a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. These symptoms last for 1 or 2 weeks. But measles also causes ear infections in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who get it. As many as 1 out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. And about 1 child in every 1,000 who get measles will get encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave the child deaf or mentally disabled. For every 1,000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth prematurely. Anti-measles immunization began in Canada in 1957. Before that virtually every child went through a bout with the disease. But the single-dose vaccine was not fully effective. In August 1995 an advisory committee recommended that all children be given a second dose of vaccine. The new policy was adopted in all provinces and territories. Rubella, commonly referred to as German measles, is a different disease with similar symptoms. It remains a problem and is one of the next targets for elimination. Measles is the latest in a string of successes for childhood vaccination programs, but experts fear they could be undermined by growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization. Last year a group of Manitoba parents went to court in an effort to block a program to immunize Grade Four students against Hepatitis B.

After 22 years on death row, the Alberta native became the first Canadian to be executed in the U.S. since 1952. He was sentenced to death for the 1975 murder of a Texas woman. A last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the execution was rejected, and Texas Governor George W. Bush said he would not issue a stay of execution. A \"stay of execution\" delays the execution, and would have allowed Mr. Faulder's lawyer to continue her quest to allow him to live. The United States placed itself above international law, says a friend of the late man's family. \"The United States is one of our world leaders and world powers, and yet they allow the basic human rights of people to be violated in their own country,\" said Charlene Gingera, about an hour after Faulder was killed by an injection of deadly chemicals. Ms. Gingera spoke on behalf of family members who wanted to grieve Faulder's death privately. She was referring to the fact that both Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine Albright, agreed Faulder was denied his international rights because Texas officials failed to tell Canadian diplomats that he was in jail. Most countries in the world have agreed that this must be done when they arrest a citizen of another country. Texas Governor and presidential candidate George W. Bush refused to grant a stay of the execution, saying there was no new evidence that questioned the jury's verdict in the death of Inez Phillips, who Faulder was convicted of killing in 1977. \"Had Stan Faulder been a Texan in Iran or Serbia and he was not notified of his right to seek help from the U.S. consulate had he been detained, would the U.S.A. tolerate it? I don't think so,\" Ms. Gingera says. \"They are undermining international law by saying that Texas has to go ahead with what they believe to be right.\" Ms. Gingera has been working with the Faulder family since 1997 to try to get human rights groups interested in the case. She acknowledges that Americans fighting the death penalty are just a few small voices. But she adds: \"I think Stan's death will certainly be a loud voice. There are many people from around the world who responded to his case and that will not go unheard.\" Ms. Gingera says she was alarmed by comments from Alberta Reform Member of Parliament Cliff Breitkreuz, who wanted Texas officials to ignore the argument that Mr. Faulder's rights were violated when he wasn't told he could contact Canadian consular officials when he was charged with murder. \"It's frightening to see people like... Cliff Breitkreuz and various people in the province of Alberta or Canada who say it's OK to ignore a violation of international law, it's OK to ignore a violation of human rights....\" She says while Faulder's supporters struggled with their anger Thursday, the inmate himself was peaceful. \"Stan's peace had really spread to many people and his peace truly helped his friends and family around him to be filled with a sense of peace.\" In the last few days, Mr. Faulder's relatives had hoped for a stay of execution but they weren't overly optimistic, she says. \"They did know that this was something that could really happen.\" Canada does not execute prisoners.", "qas": [{"question": "When was the last time a Canadian was executed in the United States?", "id": "1999-W25-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1952", "answer_start": 177}]}, {"question": "Of which province in Canada was Stanley Faulder a native?", "id": "1999-W25-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Alberta", "answer_start": 103}]}, {"question": "What would a stay of execution have allowed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Faulder's lawyer to continue her quest to allow him to live", "answer_start": 475}]}, {"question": "How was Faulder killed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by an injection of deadly chemicals", "answer_start": 850}]}, {"question": "What has Charlene Gingera been working with the Faulder family to do since 1997", "id": "1999-W25-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to try to get human rights groups interested in his case", "answer_start": 1990}]}, {"question": "Why did Texas Governor George W.

Yugoslavia is bracing for air strikes by NATO forces. Reporters say the siren lasted about 90 seconds. There was a brief pause before the siren sounded again. Yugoslav authorities have declared a state of emergency. They are getting ready for war. They've shut down the country's main independent radio station and they're preparing shelters for the civilian population. This is happening because the coalition of countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizatoin (NATO) want to stop the Yugoslavians from invading the neighbouring region of Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is one of the republics that make up Yugoslavia. Ninety per cent of Kosovo's population are ethnic Albanians, who have been pushing for independence from Serbia. Brigadier-General Michel Maisonneuve is the senior Canadian Forces officer who has been serving with NATO. He adds that \"Kosovo is a beautiful part of Yugoslavia. It is relatively flat, with mountains surrounding it, as well as a spine that runs up the middle. The province is in large majority ethnic Albanian, with many other minorities, including Serbs, gypsies, Turks, etc. The people are hospitable and hardy.\" The conflict that is being played out today has roots that go back hundreds and hundreds of years. In 1389, Serbs lost a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire on the fields of Kosovo. The defeat marks the beginning of the end of Serbia's Medieval Empire. Kosovo became part of the Ottoman Empire. In the following centuries that battle become the key event in Serbian and Albanian national history. Over the last decade there have been many attempts at a peaceful settlement. Representatives of the NATO countries have tried to negotiate with the government of Yugoslavia. Those negotions failed earlier this week. NATO says that bombing Yugoslavia is the only way to get them to stop their assault on Kosovo. The question is no longer if, but when, NATO will begin bombing. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana assured Yugoslovia's neighbours today that the alliance would protect them in the event of attacks by Yugoslavia. Yugoslav officials say they might not be able to win a war against NATO, but they feel they can inflict serious damage. NATO military planners aren't taking the threats lightly. Few people believe that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is ready to give in. He opposes outside interference in Kosovo. The Yugoslav leader insists the problems in Kosovo are an internal Yugoslav matter. He refuses to allow any outside force into Kosovo to monitor any peace agreement. If NATO strikes proceed, Canadians will be involved.

Wang Shui-Bo is nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Documentary for his half-hour film \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square.\" The film is a Wang's perspective on the events that led up to June 4, 1989, when Chinese government troops opened fire on student demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Wang traces his personal journey through a collage of original artwork mixed with family and archival photographs.  It's a journey that begins with Wang as a loyal Communist, full of the political idealism common in China under the early years of leader Mao Tse Tung. It ends with him as an anti-government activist willing to risk his life to uphold the first stirrings of democracy. \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square\" shows how the dream starts to fade during the Cultural Revolution in the '60s and '70s, when the Red Guards attack and destroy anything linked to the old Chinese culture. And how the dream is crushed when the tanks roll in Tiananmen Square. Wang fled China after the student uprising and now lives in Montreal, Quebec.  But he was in Beijing when he learned of his Oscar nomination. Even today his film can't be shown in China. But Wang hopes that one day that will change, and explosive subjects such as the Tiananmen Square massacre will no longer be taboo. Wang believes his film delivers a message that the tragedy at Tiananmen should never happen again. \"China doesn't need a revolution. The people here don't need another revolution. We have suffered so much since 100 years ago.\" \"It's time to enjoy life,\" Wang says.

Students at W.R. Myers high school had just settled down after lunch when a 14-year-old boy walked in and shot two students, killing one. The shooting comes a week after the shooting tragedy at Columbine high school in Littleton, Colorado. \"We have a son and daughter-in-law in Denver,\" says Pastor Gartly after an evening service at Taber Evangelical Free Church where worshipers discussed the day's tragic events. The dead teenager has been identified as Jason Lang, 17. The other victim, Shane Christmas, also 17, had emergency surgery yesterday at Lethbridge Regional Hospital. This morning his condition was reported as fair to serious. The two grade 11 students were said to be best friends. Eight thousand people live in Taber, which is 300 kilometres southeast of Calgary. Many members of the community are members of the Mormon Church or are evangelical Christians. Taber was founded at the beginning of the century. It is mainly made up of decendents of the area's early homestead pioneers, of Central European, Polish, Japanese, Dutch and various other racial backgrounds. Many Japanese came in 1943, Polish war veterans in 1947, and many Dutch immigrants came after about 1950. Many native Canadians also live in the region. \"You feel pain for the families, the young fellow who was shot and killed is a son of people we've gotten to know, his father is a pastoral colleague,\" said Mr. Gartly. \"Our youth pastor spent 45 minutes with the youth group tonight.

In Calgary, Alberta, for example, the Unitarian Church is sponsoring a group of refugees. This means everything from finding clothes and shelter to finding schools for the children and jobs for their parents. One member of the church, Thordis Gutnick, will be spending the next couple of months teaching English to the refugees.

More refugees will continue to arrive under Canada's family reunification plan. \"Some 2,000 people have been identified as potentially eligible for that program.

Mexico has about 200,000 archeological sites, and only about 150 are monitored constantly and open to the public, he said. \"It's quite difficult to take care of them. We depend much on the people who live near the sites.\" Although Mexico has had laws to prevent looting since the middle of the 19th century, Mexicans have become increasingly alarmed lately about losing their national heritage to looters, and have started to apply their laws with greater vigilance. Mr. Hudon was a prime example of the new get-tough attitude. The former college student was found carrying eight pieces of ceramics, which he said he found on a path in the bush near the Palenque historical site in southern Mexico. Mr. Hudon has said he had intended to hand over the pottery to authorities, but before he had a chance to do so, he was stopped by police. They searched him and charged him with illegally possessing artifacts. He was put in a federal prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas state in the south of Mexico at the beginning of January. At a trial in February, he was sentenced to a year in jail plus one month of labour, and told to pay $72,000 to the National Institute of History and Anthropology. His family and friends in Montreal protested, and Mr. Hudon went on a hunger strike. The Canadian embassy intervened, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spoke publicly about the need to get the young man out of prison in Chiapas. Last month, Mr. Hudon appealed the case. He was allowed to give a new statement through a translator. The judge ruled that he was not legally obliged to pay $72,000 to the institute, and lowered the fine to $2,500. Artifacts, some dating back tens of thousands of years, are frequently stolen when sites are discovered by excavators or through small-scale looting, he said. There has been looting at only three major projects in the past 15 years -- projects run by foreign experts. All three were halted and many artifacts recovered. Small-scale looting, however, has landed between 40 and 50 people in jail every year. And Mr. Garcia is sure much theft goes undetected. Despite his serious troubles, Pascal has not lost the urge to travel. He told his mom that after he visits with his family back in Montreal, he wants to head out to British Columbia to work as a tree-planter.

There is only one unionized McDonald's restaurant in North America. It is in Squamish, British Columbia. About 90 per cent of the outlet's 55 workers voted against unionizing. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters had been trying to organize the workers for 16 months. Rejean Lavigne, head of the Teamsters local behind the campaign, said almost all of the original employees who signed union cards in 1997 had quit and the new ones, some as young as 16, didn't want a union. \"If we lose, well, we can't do anything more,\" Lavigne said before the vote was tallied. \"If the employees don't want us there, what are you going to do?\" A statement from McDonald's Quebec regional office welcomed the vote. \"We believe that giving all the employees in the outlet the opportunity to determine the outcome of this matter was the fairest and most responsible way to resolve the question of union representation,\" the statement said. The McDonald's in Squamish became the first unionized outlet among the chain's more than 15,000 outlets in North America when the Canadian Auto Workers made a breakthrough last August. Rejection of the union in Montreal was the second failure for the Teamsters against the chain. Last year, a franchise in suburban St-Hubert, Quebec shut down just as the union was about to be certified. The latest loss means an end to a campaign begun last year to unionize at least one McDonald's in every major city across Canada, which has so far cost the Teamsters about $100,000. Union officials in Quebec say lengthy delays used by employers to fight certification played into McDonald's hands by discouraging its young employees. \"We received petitions saying thank you for the good work but we don't need you any more,\" Lavigne said. \"The workers fired us in effect.\"", "qas": [{"question": "How many McDonald's restaurants are there in North America?", "id": "1999-W09-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "15,000", "answer_start": 1127}]}, {"question": "Where is the only unionized McDonald's in North America?", "id": "1999-W09-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Squamish, British Columbia", "answer_start": 186}, {"text": "Squamish", "answer_start": 186}, {"text": "British Columbia", "answer_start": 196}]}, {"question": "When was the McDonald's unionized?", "id": "1999-W09-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "last August", "answer_start": 1210}]}, {"question": "What happened when the Teamsters tried to unionize a McDonald's in Montreal?", "id": "1999-W09-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "workers voted against becoming members of a trade union", "answer_start": 60}, {"text": "55 workers voted against unionizing", "answer_start": 248}, {"text": "workers voted against unionizing", "answer_start": 251}]}, {"question": "According to their Quebec office, how did McDonald's feel about the vote to unionize the Montreal franchise?", "id": "1999-W09-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they welcomed the vote", "answer_start": 796}, {"text": "it's the fairest and most responsible way to resolve the question of union representation", "answer_start": 931}]}, {"question": "Why did the St-Hubert McDonald's not get unionized?", "id": "1999-W09-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it got shut down just as the union was about to be certified", "answer_start": 1371}]}]}]}, {"title": "A Step to Curing Diabetes", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A team of Calgary researchers says that they have discovered one of the causes of diabetes. The scientists have spent the last eight years in the lab trying to pinpoint the immune system's role in diabetes. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon and his team at the University of Calgary say their research gives insight into what triggers insulin-dependent diabetes. But, diabetics will have to be patient -- a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away. However, that didn't temper the enthusiasm of diabetic Holly McWilliams. \"This is very exciting,\" said the 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay alive. She now uses an insulin pump to maintain proper levels of the hormone. Diabetics are at risk of blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure, but with proper diet, exercise and insulin, it can be controlled. There are at least two strands of diabetes: Type 1 -- when the body doesn't produce insulin. Type 2 -- when insulin in the body doesn't work properly. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery affects Type 1 diabetics, which inflicts about 100,000 Canadians. One and a half million Canadians have diabetes; more than 750,000 have it and don't know it. \"This is a major landmark study and it helps us understand the disease in a way we haven't in the past,\" says Dr. David Lau of the Julia McFarlane Diabetes Research Centre. Dr. Yoon's research on mice focuses on how a diabetic's immune system attacks cells that produce insulin, which is needed to help the body properly use sugars. A protein in the pancreas, which produces insulin, plays a critical role in triggering diabetes in mice. Destruction of insulin-producing cells by the immune system can be prevented by halting protein production. Dr. Yoon said his work could lead to transplants of tissue that fight the sugar build-up process or possibly a vaccine. Lau is confident studies on mice will also work on humans.", "qas": [{"question": "How many Canadians have diabetes and don't realize it?", "id": "1999-W20-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than 750,00", "answer_start": 1183}]}, {"question": "What kinds of health problems do diabetics potentially face?", "id": "1999-W20-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure", "answer_start": 757}]}, {"question": "How is diabetes currently controlled?", "id": "1999-W20-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "proper diet, exercise and insulin", "answer_start": 833}]}, {"question": "What does insulin do for our bodies?", "id": "1999-W20-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "helps the body properly use sugers", "answer_start": 1531}]}, {"question": "What do Type 1 diabetics' immune systems do to insulin-producing cells?", "id": "1999-W20-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "attacks them", "answer_start": 1471}]}, {"question": "Where does Dr. Yoon's team work?", "id": "1999-W20-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the University of Calgary", "answer_start": 239}, {"text": "Calgary", "answer_start": 10}]}, {"question": "Why will diabetics have to be patient, despite Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery?", "id": "1999-W20-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away", "answer_start": 387}]}, {"question": "Who is Holly McWilliams?", "id": "1999-W20-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": " a diabetic", "answer_start": 1444}, {"text": "an 18-year-old Calgarian", "answer_start": 223}, {"text": "an 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay alive", "answer_start": 547}]}]}]}, {"title": "Melissa Virus Travels the Net", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Computer security experts are warning computer users around the world to be on guard today for \"important\" e-mail messages that carry a damaging computer virus. The virus is called \"Melissa.\" Melissa, identified by symbols that form a winking smiley face, usually contains the subject line, \"Important message,\" and the body says \"Here is that document you asked for ... don't show it to anyone else.\" The virus launches documents into cyberspace and can clog e-mail servers, security experts said yesterday. Users may think they are receiving e-mail from a friend because the virus takes real addresses out of a users own address books. Over the weekend, businesses and governments around the world were contacting experts to see if Melissa can be stopped. One team of virus experts is at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The university has a \"Computer Emergency Response Team.\"  Katherine Fithen is with the team. She says the Melissa e-mail should be considered a potential security breach. \"It's safe to say we're bracing ourselves,\" she says. The Melissa virus spreads via Microsoft's widely used Word 97 and Word 2000 documents, which can be attached to e-mail messages, as well as Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail program. If a computer user opens the infected Word document, the virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book and sends an infected message to the first 50 entries. People cannot get the virus by merely opening up a message, only by opening the attached document. REMEMBER, NEVER OPEN A DOCUMENT ATTACHMENT FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW. And now in this case, you can't even trust all the documents you receive from people you do know! Use common sense, and always be careful of anything that you receive via e-mail. Carnegie-Mellon's experts first learned of the virus Friday afternoon and its members worked through the night to analyze it. But the full reach of the virus may only become clear today when millions sit down at their computer terminals. Several antivirus software makers have posted patches on their Web sites to detect and reject the virus. People can also protect themselves by not opening the attachments, Ms. Fithen says. Ms. Fithen declined to say if any government's security was breached and wouldn't name anyone whose files had been damaged.

More than a hockey rink, it's a cultural institution. It may well be the strongest link between Toronto and the rest of Canada. And this weekend, the Gardens are losing the Maple Leafs. For thousands of people from coast to coast to coast, this Saturday is a special hockey night in Canada. It will be the last time the Leafs take to the ice at Maple Leaf Gardens. With the end in sight, the hype -- and mourning -- is beginning in earnest. More than one building in one city, the Gardens has long been a focal point for Canadian culture -- at least for anyone who has ever strapped on the blades. For decades, NHL games were broadcast into living rooms From Plum Coulee, Manitoba to Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, and beyond from one of two places -- the Gardens or the Montreal Forum. With the end in sight, fond memories are starting to flow. In recent weeks, for example, hockey fans from Western Canada have been making the trek to Toronto to see one last game at the Gardens. Two weeks ago Brent Shuya and his son made the 3-and-a-half hour drive from their home in Russell, Manitoba to Winnipeg. There they hopped on an airplane for another two hour ride to Toronto.  The reason: to see their one and only hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens. Brent says, \"it was pretty important to me, I wanted my son to go and visit the Gardens, seeing how they are not going to be playing there anymore. I've always been a Leaf fan probably since I was five or six years old and I guess I always will be whether they win or lose, and it was just nice to see them play in their old home.\" But Brent Shuya is by no means the only western hockey fan who has made one final pilgrimage to Maple Leaf Gardens. On his trip he met other fans from the Prairies doing the same thing. There is no one explanation as to why some fans outside Toronto feel such a strong attachment to the Leafs and the building in which they play, although radio and television have had much to do with it. Fans like Winnipeg businessman Jeff Thompson will be at the final game on Saturday. \"The Gardens and the Montreal Forum were both places that although we were never there, as kids growing up we were there,\" he says. \"They came into our house every weekend. It became larger than life because we had grown up watching it\". Winnipeger Bill Juzda was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL when he played for the Leafs in the 1950s. Mr. Juzda expects many of those at the final game Saturday will feel pretty much the way he did when he first walked into Maple Leaf Gardens nearly 50 years ago. He says, \"you walked in and you seen all those pictures in the lobby and everything else. And you stood outside and said, hey, I used to listen to Foster Hewitt on the radio and boy am I lucky to be here.\" Foster Hewitt was the Maple Leafs' radio broadcaster for decades. His voice was known by Canadians from coast to coast. He first broadcast a hockey game on the radio in March, 1923. Decades later he became the Leafs' first television announcer. In Toronto, many residents are sad to see the Leafs abandon the Gardens for the new Air Canada Centre. One fan is Tommy Gaston. For almost 60 years, the 82-year-old and his wife Ruth were in their seats for Leafs home games -- Grey Section West, Seats 13 and 14. After Saturday, the Gastons will have just their fond memories of the Gardens, built in 1931. But Gaston won't have trouble preserving his memories. A self-described pat rack, he has collected enough memorabilia to stock his basement -- and donate the overflow to the Hockey Hall of Fame.", "qas": [{"question": "What type of sports facility does Maple Leaf Gardens function as?", "id": "1999-W07-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a hockey rink", "answer_start": 30}]}, {"question": "When was the Maple Leaf Gardens built?", "id": "1999-W07-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1931", "answer_start": 3388}]}, {"question": "Where is the Maple Leaf Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Toronto", "answer_start": 116}]}, {"question": "How far did Brent Shuya and his son have to drive just to reach Winnipeg?", "id": "1999-W07-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "3 and a half hours", "answer_start": 3290}, {"text": "3 1/2 hours", "answer_start": 1045}]}, {"question": "When did Foster Hewitt start broadcasting Maple Leaf games on the radio?", "id": "1999-W07-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "March, 1923", "answer_start": 2961}]}, {"question": "Where did Tommy and Ruth sit for the Leaf's games at the Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Grey Section West, Seats 13 and 14", "answer_start": 3264}]}, {"question": "Who was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL in the 1950s?", "id": "1999-W07-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Bill Juzda", "answer_start": 2318}]}]}]}, {"title": "Are Albertans Stingy?", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Albertans are rich in wealth but poor in spirit, says the author of a recent study.

Yalnizyan also noted that Albertans are extremely competitive, and have a \" law of the jungle\" view of life. It's this outlook of, `If you can get it, keep it. And if you're not getting it, then you're a loser,''' Ms. Yalnizyan said Thursday during a speech. Yalnizyan added that she did not hear that type of thinking in too many places in Canada. Yalnizyan's report is for the Centre For Social Justice in Toronto. It uses Statistics Canada figures to look at growing income differences between Canada's rich and poor. When Yalnizyan looked at the Alberta data, she discovered that while Alberta's economy is growing, the difference between the rich and poor is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else in Canada. The difference is most noticeable in Calgary where the city's prosperity has meant more high-paying management jobs, but also more unstable and low-paying part-time work. Yalnizyan feels that attitudes are as much to blame for this inequality as government spending cuts, a low minimum wage and the spread of part-time jobs. She argues that cultural expectations are one of the first factors shaping the way the labour market performs. One example, she said, is Albertans' enthusiasm for tax cuts even though the province's health care and education systems are in bad shape, and need tax money to be improved. \"There's a kind of sky's-the-limit attitude.

The mammoth was found in Siberia, a large area in Russia with a cold climate similar to Canada's far north. His head has decomposed, but his body remains intact under the permanently frozen tundra. Scientists hope to create an exact duplicate mammoth through cloning techniques. To do this, they will use the DNA they hope to find in the mammoth's soft tissues and hair. The scientists say the colour of the mammoth's hair is still present, as is the smell of the skin. This means the hair or skin may still contain the DNA needed for the cloning experiment.

His parents feared that Geoffrey and his older sister would be killed in the Nazi bombing of England. But there was a way to keep the kids safe. They took advantage of the Commonwealth child evacuation program.  Over 2,600 British children were sent to live with families in other Commonwealth countries where the war was not raging. Over half of those children -- 1530 of them -- came to live in Canada as guests. Some, like Geoffrey Dewis, returned to Canada to spend the rest of their lives. During the war, the trip to Canada was not easy.  German submarines lurked in the North Atlantic sea where the boats traveled. They fired torpedoes at British and Allied ships. Geoffrey Dewis's ship was the last to arrive safely at its destination.  The next boatload of British kids, on a ship called The City of Benares, was torpedoed and sank. Seventy-seven children on board died. Tragically, that was the end of the \"guest child\" program.

Ocalan leads a separatist group that has fought for the creation of an independent Kurdistan. Kurds live in lands controlled by Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. An estimated 20,000 people have died in the fighting of the past 15 years. In London, England, the Greek embassy was temporarily occupied, and hundreds of Kurds are continuing to protest outside the embassy. In Ottawa on Wednesday, Kurdish demonstrators hurled a gasoline bomb at a police line, setting one officer on fire. The group of 400 protesters was fighting with a riot squad outside the Turkish Embassy. In all, 10 police officers were injured in the fighting. In Greece, the foreign minister, the interior minister and the public order minister handed in their resignations because they failed to protect the Kurdish rebel leader. Ocalan was captured earlier this week while hiding in the Greek embassy in Kenya. Turkey considers Ocalan an enemy because he's been fighting an ongoing battle for a separate Kurdish homeland. He could face the death penalty. Ocalan's supporters have been protesting at Turkish, Greek and Israeli embassies in Europe and Canada. On Wednesday, after rumours that Israel helped Turkish securities forces capture Ocalan, angry Kurds tried to occupy the Israeli consulate in Berlin. Israeli guards opened fire on the protesters, killing three and injuring 16 others. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to calm Kurdish anger. But he defends the killings and says his nation had nothing to do with Ocalan's arrest. In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Kurds they must obey German laws and stop violent protests -- or they will be thrown out of the country. In Turkey, police have reportedly arrested hundreds of supporters of the main Kurdish party, while up to 4,000 soldiers have been sent into Northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebel bases.

At least 46 people were killed and hundreds were left injured and homeless. A tornado is an extremely violent windstorm that is usually created within a thunderstorm or hurricane. The recognizable shape of the tornado is the swirling funnel cloud that extends from the base of a storm cloud to the ground. The Oklahoma state medical examiner said 40 people were killed in Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms, the largest of which formed about 110 kilometres southwest of Oklahoma City - cutting a path at least a kilometre wide as it moved north and east. About 400 kilometres miles north, a tornado spawned by the same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kansas and its suburb of Haysville. Hospitals reported treating more than 80 people. Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office said today that the initial count of 10 deaths proved wrong when authorities realized victims had been counted twice. But authorities still fear more dead will be found. \"It is worse than what you can see,\" says Bob Thompson, a battalion chief for the Sedgwick County Fire Department. \"We'll probably find more deaths.\" The storm system began in southwest Oklahoma and moved into the neighboring state of Kansas. It included several tornadoes, one of which was nearly two kilometres wide at times. Witnesses say the twister was like a huge white train that came crashing through their homes. Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his companions were critically injured. \"I have no trailer,\" Harris said. \"We all rolled in it. It was the worst experience in my life.\" The Oklahoma City twister is ranked as an F-4 tornado, the second-strongest classification. An F-4 tornado has a wind speed of 333-419 kilometres per hour. It can level well-constructed houses, structures with weak foundations can be blown off some distance, cars are thrown and objects like trees can become airborne like missiles.

They set off this week on foot and by camel on a grueling trek across the burning Arabian desert. When they were still in Canada, planning their trip, they expected they would feel lonely. But after two days into the 1,200 kilometre journey, the caravan has won celebrity status among the native Bedouin people and government officials of Oman. Some have excitedly tagged along, says expedition leader Jamie Clarke. Mr. Clarke is making the trek with his older brother Leigh and their friend Bruce Kirby. They have hired three  guides. They are now in the Omani city of Solalah on the Arabian Sea. The group was forced to return briefly to replace some broken equipment, notably camel saddles, 40 kilometres into the odyssey. The adventurers expect to travel for up to 55 days through the scorching heat and towering dunes of Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They are attempting to become the first Westerners in more than 50 years to cross the Empty Quarter of Arabia, the world's largest sand desert. Mr. Clarke has adventure in his blood. He scaled Mount Everest in the Himalayas in 1997. Now he and his companions are following a famous route taken by British adventurer Sir Wilfred Thesiger in 1947. They are journeying through the harsh and mostly uninhabited desert wearing the clothes and eating the food that is traditional for the nomadic Bedouin people. \"It's quite an event here to have us crossing the desert in such a traditional fashion and in the footsteps of Thesiger,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"So, our team can be anywhere from our six normal members on up to quadruple that size at night when people walk into camp or walk along with us to cheer us on.\" The site of the expedition's camp Wednesday was the Ayoon pools, north of Solalah, where temperatures during the day rise to 45 degrees Celsius  and fall at night to as low as 3 degrees Celsius. The start of the trip was delayed because of technical problems with communications equipment for use in emergencies and because of stomach problems after Clarke had his first taste of the Bedouin delicacy of goat brains. \"When the Bedouin cook, they are accustomed to using all of the animal. Every edible piece of the creature is in the pot, among them are some of the unsavory stuff like brains,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"I'm keen to try everything and sometimes it just doesn't agree. A little nausea, throwing up and diarrhea shouldn't hold somebody back.\" Mr. Clarke and his companions met with Mr. Thesiger, who is now 88, in London, England on their way to the Middle East from Canada. Mr. Thesiger's book Arabian Sands told the story of his 1947 trek. Among Mr. Thesiger's words of advice for the trio was to take great care of the camels because their lives depend on the very stubborn animals as transportation for themselves and their provisions. \"I don't think we really understood the magnitude of that statement, which is so simple and obvious. Yet in the first two weeks of our training here and the first two days of our journey, it's incredible how powerful that statement is,\" Mr. Clarke says. From Solalah, the route will take the group through Saudi Arabia and the trek will finish in Abu Dhabi.

The two boys who carried this out belonged to a group of teenagers who called themselves the \"Trenchcoat Mafia.\" There are reports that a bomb exploded late Tuesday night as police tried to remove it. A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department has said bomb squads may need several days to complete searching the school for explosives. There is as of right now no apparent reason for the shootings other than the boys have told schoolmates in the past that they felt they did not fit in. Their gang reportedly disliked minorities and athletes. Witnesses said the boys laughed as they methodically moved through the school shooting people at random. Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone described their actions as a \"suicide mission.\" Outside the school, police arrested three young men who've been described as friends and possibly accomplices of the gunmen. American President Bill Clinton went on television yesterday to express his condolences to the families and friends of the victims. He said the challenge facing America is to teach its young people to resolve their problems with \"words not weapons.\" Clinton said he would have more to say on the issue of violence in the school system later this week. The rampage began just before noon as the two boys in black trench coats and black masks walked into the school, armed with guns and explosives. One witness said they seemed to be shooting at random and shouting that they were seeking \"revenge.\" For hours, students inside the building hid in fear for their lives. Some students took cover the school's choir room and were able to stay in touch with police by using their cell phones. Students have said that the teacher who shepherded the students into the choir room is a hero. Hours later, the gunmen were found dead in the library.

Authorities said they were able to clear 90 per cent of the students out of the building almost immediately. The rest were cleared out after the shooting stopped. Because of the shooting, Colorado lawmakers have put off adopting a law that would help gun owners carry concealed weapons.

Ms. McLellan says Judge Arbour will make sure the tribunal continues to pursue its cases against Milosevic and his fellow accused ministers. She says Judge Arbour's work prosecuting war crimes would enhance the Supreme Court, describing her as \"a woman who has dealt with some of the most difficult and challenging issues of our modern time. \"I think it is unquestioned that she will make a singular contribution to the highest court in the land.\" Judge Arbour's last major act as chief prosecutor was to indict Slobodan Milosevic for crimes against humanity two weeks ago -- the first time an international court has charged a sitting head of state with war crimes. She held the Yugoslav President personally responsible, along with four of his aides, for the horrors in Kosovo and the brutal purge of ethnic Albanians. It appears to be no coincidence that Ms. McLellan announced the appointment the day after NATO and Yugoslav generals signed a detailed military agreement on the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serb forces from Kosovo. The government was very aware of how tricky it would be to take her away from her high-profile assignment of prosecuting Milosevic. Judge Arbour will not start work until September 15th. Judge Arbour is seen as having a sound knowledge of the law, coupled with an understanding of the practical implications that judgments have on people.

But roughly 1,500 residents were able to return to their homes last night as winds died and the danger decreased. A number of homes and businesses on the town's northern edge were destroyed. And the evacuees remained on alert, ready to run again on a moment's notice if hot spots flared up. La Ronge is a community of 2,800 people located 300 kilometres north of Saskatoon. It is located on lac La Ronge. Residents \"have to go back with the understanding that they could be called out at any moment,\" says RCMP Cpl. Gary MacDonald. Although the evacuees were told they could spend the night in the local arena, virtually all the townspeople chose to sleep in their own beds. Volunteer firefighters were to remain on patrol all night, ready to run door-to-door and give the alert if winds picked up and sparked a new blaze. Trees were still burning at Gary Vettree's in Eagle Point, which was directly in the path of a fast-moving fire. His was one of two homes still standing; seven houses just down the road burned to the ground. Vettree saved his house by soaking it with water. \"Scary, really scary,\" he says of the blaze, \"Smoke, fire, animals running all over, rabbits, birds.\" After days of dry winds and electrical storms - there have been 3,000 lightning strikes over the last couple days - the fire began in the bush southwest of town at about noon Thursday. Strong winds pushed it northeast and by 1 p.m., when the fire grew dangerously close to a bulk fuel station, RCMP were running from door to door asking people to leave. \"People were crying,\" says one resident, who loaded up his photo albums and hooked his prized boat to his car before leaving his home with his wife. \"At that point the fire was about a quarter-mile away.\" The fire shot six metres above the trees as it roared through the industrial area of town. Highway 2 was closed. \"I watched the fire, when it was just feet away from an industrial shop, burn the end of the building,\" said the man, who didn't want his name used. Evacuees were housed in the local health clinic and a hockey arena. \"In some places it was so bad you could hardly see,\" says restaurant worker Angela Krienke. Some evacuees with respiratory problems received treatment. There are 459 firefighters fighting the fires in Northern Saskatchewan. Working or on standby for fire suppression activities are: 24 helicopters, 12 water bomber aircraft, 8 bulldozers and 1 swamp tractor. Early damage estimates include a shop burned out in the industrial area. Several mobile homes were destroyed, as were four large buildings and four cabins at a local lakeside resort. No injuries were reported. \"It's amazing that so much vegetation on the perimeter of our community was totally destroyed and we were very fortunate that so little property was destroyed,\" says La Ronge Mayor Joe Hordyski. \"It's just a miracle.\" In northern Alberta, meanwhile, a forest fire just north of Fort McMurray threatened the region's power supply as it burned out of control Thursday. There are a number of fires burning near Fort McMurray, three out of control. None were threatening the town.

Try 40,000 years, to be precise. New research suggests that's how long people have inhabited the Yukon. That is tens of thousands of years earlier than originally thought. The previously accepted theory about the populating of North America was that the first inhabitants crossed a land bridge from Asia into what is now Alaska roughly 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, after the last Ice Age. Since the 1960s, scientists have pointed to \"Clovis points\" - 10,000 to 11,000-year-old stone tools found throughout much of unglaciated North America. But recently, scientists have suggested that the region known as Eastern Beringia, now in the eastern Yukon, could have been inhabited at least as far back as 25,000 years ago. Some researchers think habitation of the Americas dates back even further. \"My view is that there is no question that there were people in Eastern Beringia 40,000 years ago, and this view has to be taken into serious consideration if you want to discuss the peopling of the New World,\" says Jacques Cinq-Mars, an archeologist at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. At that time, during an ice age, much of North America sat under a kilometre-thick slab of glacial ice. But the Beringia area, which stretched from Siberia across Alaska and Yukon and into the Northwest Territories, remained ice-free. The latest evidence supporting the earlier dates was found in the Bluefish Caves, on the Bluefish River about 50 kilometres southeast of Old Crow. Archeologists found in the caves a mammoth bone that was probably flaked and shaped by human hands roughly 23,500 years ago. The caves also contained hundreds of bones from at least 18 species of migratory birds. The bones are anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000 years old. Many of the bird bones also show human-made cut marks. Mr. Cinq-Mars believes the caves were likely used by hunters over a period of roughly 15,000 years. The Bluefish Caves were re-discovered by Mr. Cinq-Mars in 1975. He led a research team that excavated the caves 1978 and 1987. The team's findings are showcased at the Beringia Interpretive Centre on the Alaska Highway. Heather Pringle is the author of In Search of Ancient North America, part of which is about the Bluefish Caves in northern Yukon. She says that \"most people still think of archeologists as wild guys in jungles looking for priceless artifacts to go in a museum.

The refugees have been living in tents in the Stenkovac refugee camp in Macedonia since they left Yugoslavia. The plane touched down at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia, at 1 a.m. local time, 10 hours behind schedule. The tired Albanians put on smiles for Red Cross volunteers and military officials. They told waiting reporters they were grateful for the safety Canada provides, but it was clear many will spend their time in Canada dreaming of returning home. On hand to greet his countrymen was Burnaby, British Columbia resident Shamsay Amoosa. Mr. Amoosa fled his homeland six years ago - from a civil war that few outside the country then paid attention to. \"Canada is a good country,\" Amoosa told the refugees. \"You will be safe here until things are better at home and then we will help you go back if you want.\" Ahmet Konyoury, who was on the plane with his wife and youngest daughter, said he didn't want to leave Kosovo. Rather, he had no choice. \"People over there, like Serbian military, said 'You like NATO, go there,' 'You like Clinton, go there,'\" he told CBC News through a translator. The Konyourys were one of the lucky ones who made it to Canada. At the filthy and overcrowded camps on Wednesday, thousands of refugees waited anxiously to hear their names called for overbooked flights to Canada. Officials had overbooked the plane after some families changed their mind at the last minute and didn't show up for the first flight. But on Wednesday, almost all the families lined up for the flight -- plus some. That meant delays as officials tried to sort out who would go and who must stay. Like the Konyourys -- and the refugees who wait still -- each person, each family, has a story about their plight, and their hopes for the future. The United Nations says the Kosovo refugee crisis could grow by another half million. Here are the numbers so far: 17,000 refugees in Bosnia, 62,000 in Montenegro, 404,000 in Albania, and 211,000 in Macedonia. There seems to be some movement towards putting an end to the war in Yugoslavia. The world's major powers may be close to a diplomatic breakthrough to end the conflict. The Group of Eight nations, including Russia, the United States, and Canada, have agreed to a seven-point plan to find peace in Kosovo, including the basic terms of an international force to secure the return of refugees. The plan must now be approved by the United Nations Security Council, which represents 185 countries from all over the world.

Well, that is exactly what the federal government is doing concerning a million dollar gift to the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario.  And it appears the government does not like what it has found. To continue the metaphor, it look like this horse has some major dental problems. The government has been looking at a charitable donation by Ottawa Senators hockey star Alexi Yashin. Earlier this year he promised to give one million dollars to the National Arts Centre, a concert hall where people go to see plays and dance and to hear live music. Many Canadians were delighted to see that Alexi Yashin was donating so much money. Mr. Yashin makes a salary of more than three million dollars a season. It is very expensive to put on live performances and the National Arts Centre has recently had to raise ticket prices and cut back on performances because of a lack of funds. It was the most famous donation ever to the National Arts Centre. Mr. Yashin's popularity soared. But then this week Mr. Yashin's donation turned sour. After giving the Centre $200,000 Alexi Yashin made an about face. He decided not to give the other $800,000 he had promised. He says his decision was for personal reasons. But it now looks like Alexi Yashin was not really being honest. It seems he actually changed his mind because federal Auditor General Denis Desautels told him he was trying to break the law. Mr. Yashin originally announced he was a lover of the arts. He said that as a well paid hockey player he wanted to help the National Arts Centre put on new performances. But behind the scenes his plan was not to give the Arts Centre one million dollars. Instead, in a secret agreement, the National Arts Centre would have hired Mr. Yashin's parents at $85,000 a year. They would have been paid out of Alexi Yashin's yearly $200,000 donation. What's more, his parents would not have to actually work. This was a way for Alexi Yashin to give money to his parents while illegally saving thousands of dollars in taxes. As well, a lawyer working for Mr. Yashin was to get $15,000 out of the remaining $115,000. So in fact the million dollar donation would really only be half of that. It would have been a great public relations victory. Mr. Yashin would look like he was being very generous. But behind the scenes he was really much less so. Yesterday evening the Ottawa Senators were playing in Boston. After the game reporters went to the locker room to ask Alexi Yashin what was going on. But he refused to talk to reporters about his \"personal reasons\" for cancelling his donation. He said simply that \"I know I didn't do anything illegal. I know I didn't do anything wrong. I can't control what they say. It's a free country.\" He also said he wanted to focus on hockey and nothing else. The other players and coach of the Ottawa Senators would not comment either. They said it was Alexi's personal affair and not important to them. Many Ottawa-area hockey fans are deeply disappointed with what is going on. \"People here are puzzled. They feel let down,\" says Rick Soweita, who owns a sports bar. \"He benefited from the publicity and now he's got to own up.\"", "qas": [{"question": "How much does Alexi Yashin earn as a hockey player?", "id": "1999-W04-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than three million dollars a season", "answer_start": 794}]}, {"question": "Who does Alexi Yashin play for?", "id": "1999-W04-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ottawa Senators", "answer_start": 475}]}, {"question": "How much money did Alexi Yashin actually donate to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "$200,000", "answer_start": 1187}]}, {"question": "Why do people go to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to see plays and dance and to hear live music", "answer_start": 635}]}, {"question": "How would Alexi's parents have benefited from his donation to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they would earn $85,000 a year ", "answer_start": 1894}, {"text": "the National Arts Centre would have hired them at $85,000 a year", "answer_start": 1812}]}, {"question": "Where did reporters question Alexi Yashin?", "id": "1999-W04-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in the locker room", "answer_start": 51}, {"text": "Boston", "answer_start": 2518}]}]}]}, {"title": "First Artificial Eyes", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A Canadian brain surgeon is sharing the glory in the development of one of the world's first artificial eyes.

John Girvin, a neurosurgery (brain surgery) professor in London, Ontario is the doctor who implanted the electrodes in the patient's brain at the New York Neurological Institute in 1979. It was part of an international research effort to develop artificial sight.

He perceives specks of light that appear and disappear as his field of vision shifts. But that was enough to help him locate a blackstocking cap hanging on a white wall and place it on the head of a mannequin in a recent demonstration. He also recognized a five-centimetre-tall letter from 1.5 metres away. The blind patient wears glasses with a tiny camera mounted on one lens and an ultrasonic rangefinder on the other. Both devices communicate with the small computer carried on the man's hip. The computer sends signals to small electrodes on the surface of Jerry's brain, using wires entering his skull behind his right ear. It looks like something you would see in a science fiction film. The electrodes stimulate certain brain cells, allowing Jerry to perceive the specks of light. Girvin said the artifician eye has \"great potential,\" but it's hard to predict how fast it can be perfected to something more like real sight. \"The technology is available now.

The former British colony formally joined confederation on March 31, 1949 -- 82 years after Canada became a country. Some Newfoundlanders marked the occasion by re-creating the vote that brought the province into Canada. The town of Saint Anthony staged a referendum during the last 10 days but with a different result than that of half a century ago. This time the \"No\" side won by a slim margin. Of the 934 people who cast ballots, 53 per cent opposed joining Canada. In fact, the referendum also mirrors history. The first time Newfoundlanders voted in 1948 they rejected union with Canada. It was only in the second vote that Newfoundlanders said \"yes\". It's a result many Newfoundlanders and their politicians have wondered about over the years. Where would Newfoundland be today if the referendum results had been reversed and 52 per cent of voters chose independence? Newfoundlander John Crosbie was a minister in the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.  He thinks the province may have been all right on its own. \"It is highly likely we would have survived,\" Crosbie said. \"It would have been a lot more work and more difficult, but it wouldn't have been necessarily a disaster had we continued as an independent dominion.\" But Mr. Crosbie does recognize the benefits of the union. \"Our quality of life is better here today because people have a basic level of security,\" he says. Mr. Crosbie says a number of federal government programs like unemployment insurance and aid packages to fishers who are out of work are just a few of the reasons Newfoundlanders should count their blessings. Newfoundland was granted full British colonial status in the early 19th century. The Royal Navy began escorting ships to the Grand Banks fishing grounds for the summer fishing season and soon developed seasonal communities along the coast. As permanent settlements formed, civil governors replaced fishing admirals and colonial political institutions were set up. Newfoundland s first popularly elected legislative assembly convened in Saint John s in 1832. In the decades that followed, the colony was run by representative government, and later, responsible government in 1855. The population was also strongly divided by religion -- half were Protestant, half Roman Catholic. By the turn of the century, Newfoundland was a self-governing colony that played a small role in international affairs. But life in small communities dotting the coast -- called outports -- was rough. Poverty, starvation and disease were rampant. By the end of the Second World War, union with Canada was once again being mentioned. Newfoundlanders were swept up in a passionate debate between a pro-union movement called the Confederates and an anti-union movement that wanted Newfoundland to have what was called \"responsible government\", that is, to remain independent from Canada. A vote was held on July 22, 1948. On the morning of July 23, 1948, Newfoundlanders awoke to hear that the Confederates had won. It was a tight race: the pro-confederates received 52.3 per cent of the vote with responsible government getting 47.7 per cent. Newfoundland was on its way to becoming Canada s tenth province. A gala concert caps Newfoundland's celebrations this evening with guests on both sides of the unity debate. Both Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard will join in the festivities of the nationally televised event.", "qas": [{"question": "When did Newfoundland become a British colony?", "id": "1999-W14-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the early 19th century", "answer_start": 1738}]}, {"question": "Who governed the early costal communities before civil governors replaced them?", "id": "1999-W14-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "fishing admirals", "answer_start": 1979}]}, {"question": "What factor divided the population of Newfoundland in the 1800s?", "id": "1999-W14-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "religion", "answer_start": 2305}, {"text": "half were Protestant, half Roman Catholic", "answer_start": 2317}]}, {"question": "What date was the vote that made Newfoundland part of Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "July 22, 1948", "answer_start": 2964}]}, {"question": "How many people cast their votes for the \"responsible government\" in the final vote that made Newfoundland part of Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "47.7 percent", "answer_start": 3186}]}, {"question": "What were the pro-union Newfoundlanders called?", "id": "1999-W14-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Confederates", "answer_start": 2786}]}, {"question": "According to Mr. Crosbie, why do Newfoundlanders enjoy a better quality of life as a province of Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "people have a basic level of security", "answer_start": 1423}, {"text": "unemployment insurance and aid packages to fishers who are out of work", "answer_start": 1534}]}, {"question": "Who was prime minister when John Crosbie was a minister?", "id": "1999-W14-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Brian Mulroney", "answer_start": 1028}]}, {"question": "Where did Newfoundlanders recently re-create the vote that brought the province into Canada?", "id": "1999-W14-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "town of Saint Anthony", "answer_start": 286}, {"text": "Saint Anthony", "answer_start": 294}]}]}]}, {"title": "Nova Scotia School Pumps Up", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A middle school in Liverpool, Nova Scotia is pumping up bodies as well as minds. It's an example of a school teaming up with the community to raise money. South Queens Junior High School is taking aim at the fitness market. The school has turned its one-time metal shop - lost to budget cuts almost two years ago - into a money-making professional fitness club. The club will be open seven days a week. The club, operated by a non-profit society made up of school and community volunteers, has sold more than 30 memberships and hired a full-time co-ordinator. Principal Betty Jean Aucoin says the club is a first for a Nova Scotia public school. She says the school took it on itself to provide a service needed in Liverpool. \"We don't have any athletic facilities here on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, so if we don't use our schools, communities such as Queens are going to be struggling to get anything going,\" Aucoin said. More than a $100,000 was raised through fund-raising and donations from government, Sport Nova Scotia, and two local companies. Some people are wondering if the ties between the businesses and the school are too close. Schools are not set up to make profits or promote businesses. Southwest Regional School Board superintendent Ann Jones says there's no fear the lines between education and business are blurring. \"First call on any school facility belongs to... the youngsters in the school,\" says Ann Jones. The 12,000-square-foot club has seven aerobic machines, including treadmills, steppers, and stationary bicycles, as well as weight machines and freeweights. Memberships cost $180 a year for adults and $135 for students and seniors.

Canada was one of the leading countries behind the ban. In Melbourne, Australia bells rang at Saint Michael's Uniting Church. In Brasilia, the capital city of Brazil, anti-landmine pamphlets were distributed and there were screenings of \"Spotlight on a Massacre\", an anti-landmines film in Portuguese. In Paris, France members of carillon associations - people who are experts at ringing bells - coordinated the ringing of cathedral bells across the city. And there was bell-ringing in approximately 30 Buddhist temples and Christian churches in 10 cities throughout Japan, including Hiroshima, Tokyo and Osaka. The pact was agreed to by 130 countries in Ottawa, Ontario in 1997. Russia, the United States, China and Ukraine did not sign the treaty. Despite these notable absences, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams, of The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, says the accord has an impact for many other countries in the world. The head of the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the treaty's entry into force as a milestone. \"It is a day whose arrival few could have predicted, and whose import to the millions whose lives or limbs may be saved from these barbarous weapons cannot be overestimated,\" Mr. Annan said. Pope John Paul added his voice to the effort, urging more countries to sign the treaty. The treaty prohibits the use, production and storage of anti-personnel landmines and sets a time limit for destroying stocks and clearing mine fields. There are two categories of landmines: antipersonnel (AP) and antitank or anti-vehicle (AT): -Anti-personnel (AP) landmine - \"A mine designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.\" -Anti-tank (AT) landmine - An AT mine is a device designed to detonate by more than 100 kilograms of pressure. AT mines cannot distinguish between a tank and tractor The United States has refused to sign the treaty, saying it needs the mines for its defence along the border between North and South Korea. The governments of North and South Korea have been in constant conflict for more then 40 years. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spearheaded the political initiative to get the treaty ratified. \"For us, this is a very important day,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said. He said the treaty is a stepping stone to furthering what he calls the human security agenda. The challenge now, he said, is to make the pact work.", "qas": [{"question": "When was the international landmine treaty agreed to by 130 countries?", "id": "1999-W10-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1997", "answer_start": 794}]}, {"question": "Which countries refused to sign the international accord on landmines?", "id": "1999-W10-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Russia, the United States, China and Ukraine", "answer_start": 800}]}, {"question": "What do we call groups of people who are experts at ringing bells?", "id": "1999-W10-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "carillon associations", "answer_start": 450}]}, {"question": "How long have North Korea and South Korea been in conflict?", "id": "1999-W10-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than 40 years", "answer_start": 1952}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the Portuguese anti-landmine film?", "id": "1999-W10-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"Spotlight on a Massacre\"", "answer_start": 357}]}, {"question": "Who is the Secretary General of the United Nations?", "id": "1999-W10-2-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Kofi Annan", "answer_start": 1109}]}, {"question": "Where is Brasilia?", "id": "1999-W10-2-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 279}]}]}]}]}
